Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo,3 / 5,"I like the brand pantene well enough. It leave my hair very shiny, and keeps it smelling nice all day. As someone who has limited mobility in my hands though, I found the lid of this bottle very stubborn to open. I typically go for a pump lid, but have been able to open similar styles in the past. This was just a tight fit - but I will say it was great to keep the water out!! Pantene is a thick and glossy product and i’ve never found a smell I don’t like. What makes this 3 stars however is the fact that I can typically go every other day for a wash, but this shampoo has my hair greasy again in just a few hours."

Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo,3 / 5,"Pantene Daily Moisture Shampoo offers good hydration and makes hair feel soft, but it may not be ideal for very dry or damaged hair. While it provides some moisture and smoothness, it doesn’t deeply nourish or restore like some other shampoos. It lathers well and leaves a pleasant scent, but for those with thicker or more textured hair, it might not provide enough moisture. It's a decent option for everyday use if you're looking for a mild shampoo, but it might not meet the needs of those with specific hair concerns. Overall, it's a solid choice for maintaining basic moisture but could use more intensive care for dry or damaged hair."

The formula is creamy and lathers up nicely, so you don’t need a ton of product to get a thorough cleanse. It effectively removes dirt and product buildup without stripping my hair of its natural oils. After rinsing, my hair feels smooth and hydrated, even before using conditioner. The scent is a big highlight—it’s fresh and long-lasting without being overpowering. It’s also gentle enough for daily use, which is great for someone like me who washes their hair often. The only downside is that it might not be hydrating enough for extremely dry or damaged hair, so pairing it with a rich conditioner or deep treatment might be necessary for those hair types. Overall, it’s an affordable and reliable shampoo that delivers on its promise of moisture renewal. Definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a budget-friendly daily shampoo!"

Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo,2 / 5,"Pantene's Daily Renewal Shampoo offers an affordable option for those seeking a quick hair cleanse. However, its low price point comes with a trade-off: a list of ingredients that might raise concerns for health-conscious consumers. While the shampoo may leave hair feeling clean and manageable, some ingredients like sulfates and parabens can strip hair of natural oils and potentially irritate the scalp. These ingredients have been linked to various health issues, including allergies and hormone disruption. If you prioritize natural ingredients and long-term hair health, it might be worth exploring more eco-friendly and organic alternatives. These options often come with a higher price tag, but they prioritize your well-being and the environment."

Dove Daily Moisture Shampoo,5 / 5,"Thanks to Dove ""Lightness and Moisture"" shampoo, my hair became silky, soft, manageable and acquired an amazing look! I started using Dove shampoos from the first course, and that was 5 years ago! It was very difficult for me to choose a shampoo. My hair: horror, how soft, dry, unruly, frizzy and my main drawback, there is little of it in principle... Previously, I tried a restorative shampoo, my hair was like straw, broke, split... I also bought shampoos for volume, instead of hair I had a shaggy dandelion... The last thing I took was Dove shampoo! I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but with the help of shampoos from this series, my split ends stopped today! The word ""lightness"" scared me in this shampoo. I was afraid that I would have a dandelion on my head, from this lightness, but some trust in this series has already awakened in me, we decided to take it anyway. Dove Shampoo Lightness and Moisturizing: The product is intended for those who need to moisturize their hair. In principle, you can not use additional means for rinsing, but I still use the shampoo together with the Dove ""Volume and Restoration"" conditioner, as the manufacturer advises. The shampoo has an unusual design. It tapers from the bottom to the top. And now the whole yummy part! The consistency of Dove shampoos is divine! It is so soft, medium thick, milky in color. It foams easily even from a small amount of the product. The aroma is delicious, similar to all previous Dove shampoos. It stays on the hair for quite a long time. The shampoo consumption is economical, thanks to good foaming. The foam is gentle, simply the most gentle, instantly envelops the entire head. There is so much foam on the head that I can barely feel the tips of my fingers, massaging my head. And what a thrill it is to massage your head with Dove shampoos... You can plunge from head to toe into this foam, you don’t even want to wash it off, really! Words cannot describe these feelings. The lid snaps on easily, and can be opened without any problems even with wet hands:"

My hair felt softer and less prone to snapping after just a couple of uses. It also adds a touch of shine, which is a nice bonus. After a month of use, I noticed fewer split ends and less hair in my brush, so it seems to deliver on its anti-breakage promise. Plus, it didn’t weigh my hair down or leave any residue, making it perfect for regular use."
TRESemmé Anti-Breakage Strengthening Shampoo,5 / 5,"This Summer I was wearing my hair up in a ponytail a lot of the time. So I tried TRESemme Anti-Breakage shampoo (& conditioner) because they were on sale. I am normally a Herbal Essence shampoo/ conditioner fan but have found that it seems they have changed my favorite ""Hello Hydration"" and I don't care for it now. I was skeptical about this shampoo at first. I really liked the smell and after about 2 weeks I noticed a lot less hair coming out when I took my ponytail out or while brushing my hair. I also like that I need only about 2 half dollar size amount in my Palm to wash all of my hair that is rather long. It washes out very well. I am sold on the way this shampoo helps my hair. ( I do switch off and use TRESemme Flawless Curl Hydration shampoo/ conditioner that I found in a local store.) I have a lot less breakage then I have in the past I would highly recommend this product to other. Packaging was very attractive."

TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"It is designed to tame frizz and leave hair silky and manageable. Infused with keratin and argan oil, it claims to smooth hair while providing a sleek finish. It works well for dry or frizzy hair, leaving it softer and shinier after a few washes. However, the shampoo may feel heavy for those with fine or oily hair, and its sulfate content could strip color-treated hair over time. Overall, it’s a good choice for those seeking smoothness and frizz control at an affordable price point."

TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,"From my experience using TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo, it really helps to control frizz and makes my hair feel softer and shinier. I have naturally wavy hair, and after using this shampoo, it feels smoother and more manageable, especially when I pair it with the conditioner. The scent is pleasant, and it lingers without being overpowering. That said, I’ve noticed that if I use it too often, it can feel like there’s a slight residue, especially if I don’t rinse thoroughly. For someone with an oily scalp, it might not be the best for deep cleaning. Overall, though, I’d recommend it if you’re looking to tame frizz and get that smooth finish. It works well for me when my hair feels dry or frizzy."

TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have used the TRESemmé Smooth Shampoo a few times now (in conjunction with the conditioner and serum) and I agree with a number of the benefit claims that it helps with frizz control, smoothing, reduced fly aways, added shine, and softness.

TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"Finally, I tried Keratin Smooth shampoo with keratin straightening effect from TRESemme brand. You know, I really liked it. My slightly damaged Asian hair from lightening has become smooth and saturated as before! A few characteristics: shampoo of white opaque color with a mother-of-pearl sheen. The consistency is liquid, slippery, and looks more like liquid soap. The product has a very pleasant smell, sweetly floral It is very well applied to the hair, easily gets lost in a thick foam. It rinses once, in principle, even conditioner is not needed for trouble-free hair, shampoo perfectly moisturizes the hair even at the tips. What I immediately noticed after the first wash: 1. Easy to comb. The hair does not get tangled at all, it becomes smoother, it does not fluff. 2. Shine. I was afraid to get the effect of dirty, unwashed hair, but this did not happen with Keratin Smooth. The hair really shines, but at the same time it looks clean and well-groomed. My opinion: I don't know how other TRESemme products will behave, but Keratin Smooth shampoo has become my ""excellent student"". A really worthwhile product."

It also helps in reducing breakage, and I've noticed less frizz and more shine. Plus, it's budget-friendly and delivers professional-quality results without breaking the bank. Love it.I’m a fan of the TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Shampoo for its ability to keep my hair manageable and less prone to frizz. After using it for a while, my hair feels softer, and it stays sleek even when I skip the straightener. The keratin infusion seems to really help with smoothing the hair cuticle, and the price is affordable for such quality. The only thing is that it might not be ideal for very fine hair, as it could leave it feeling a bit too smooth or flat."

It helps minimize frizz and living in the south that is a necessity lol the scent is good and clean/fresh. It doesn’t leave to feminine or masculine it’s a good unisex product. It doesn’t leave my hair oily or greasy or gross at all which is great! I battle with finding a good one that is great for frizz and yet still doesn’t leave the hair too oily or greasy after drying (especially if I don’t want to blow dry it)… this one is it though for a good price.

I’ll often mix it up and use a different product every once in a while, but I always come back to this product. It keeps my hair feeling soft and strong and never builds up on my hair.

Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,"After 2 kids, my previously very thick hair has thinned out horribly. I’ve tried several things but I do think this shampoo and conditioner is making a difference. It’s not huge and I haven’t noticed new growth, but the hair I have does feel and look thicker after washing. The smell is good, too. However, it’s difficult to get the last of the product out of the bottle."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,I tried this shampoo to target my fine hair and it was pretty good for the price. The scent is nice unlike some other biotin shampoos and lathers well
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,"OGX Biotin and Collagen Shampoo is thick and lovely. It smells super nice, and has a thick rich lather that makes you confident that it is doing its job. An added bonus is extra volume in your hair"
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,1 / 5,"I have been using both the ogx thick and full + biotin & collagen shampoo & conditioner. And I am absolutely happy to finally get rid of this combo. It made my hair worse than better. It leaves it feeling thin and unclean. I washed my hair the day before the photos, and it was already oily and flat. I saw no growth or thickness. In the month I used it for. I picked up the bottles for $6 each at Walmart. Scent was not bad, like coco butter."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,3 / 5,I used this for a while hoping it would help my hair grow. I found out later that ingredients in it are not good for your hair. The scent wasn’t bad and for the price it’s not awful however if your wanting to grow your hair I would find a cleaner brand
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,"Good quality for a cheaper, drug store shampoo. It helped volumize my fine hair and kept it oil-free for 4-5 days! Normally I’d need to wash my hair every 2-3 days. The scent is very pleasant as well."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,Smells divine and I feel like it does a thorough job with washing my long hair. That said don't know if it does really help with thickening the hair as I haven't seen much difference and if I did it could be due to various factors. It is lovely though.
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,This is how my hair turned out after I used this on my curly hair. I really like it because I have noticed a change in softness in my hair. It smells like very good. I also like the purple color it just adds a bit of fun to the hair washing process.
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,I haven’t used this shampoo since college and recently my partner bought it and I was reminded why I liked it so much! It smells SO good! every time I play with my hair the scent is released again. It also makes my hair pretty soft after use as well.
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,My hair is 2b oily low porosity. It takes a special.shampoo otherwisemy hair is limp and oily.or.over dried. This one works for me.pretty well.
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo has healed my damaged hair. It smells great too! It’s has an interesting texture, almost like jelly, which is nice because I don’t accidentally drop it and waste product. It’s super affordable as well."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,"The scent is amazing and takes you straight to tropics. The packaging looks and feels premium when held. The texture is of a perfect thickness, so that you can dispense the smallest amount required easily, and don’t waste the product. I am not convinced it is a super effective product, but definitely one very pleasant to use."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,3 / 5,"I bought this shampoo to give a bit of volume and thickness to my limp fine hair. It was underwhelming! It did not give me volume nor any feel of thickness, plus my hiar falls out a lot when using this."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,1 / 5,This shampoo is awful. It has a nice scent but this shampoo gave me frizz and overall dried my hair. Mind you I have Long hair and my ends need to have hydration. I do not recommend this shampoo at all if you have long hair and want a hydrating shampoo. It unfortunately dried out my hair and this one was not a good shampoo at all. EDIT: DMDM was the culprit of drying out and leading to fallout of hair for many many years ago.

Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,1 / 5,"No thank you! I do NOT recommend. I shed a lot of hair when I shower naturally, this shampoo more than doubled the amount of shedding I had. It also did pretty much nothing for the state of my hair. The price seems nice, but the outcome is not worth it."
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,I recently purchased this after figuring out if this was still causing people’s hair to fall out. I have thin hair that comes out due to medication and I wanted to see if this would help being the fact that it has biotin in it. I like it so far haven’t noticed too much of a change but it does get your hair clean and it smells nice.
Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,1 / 5,This shampoo drys your hair so bad and makes hair fall al lots. It does make your hair grow fast but won’t stop falling. I won’t recommend this shampoo if you have hair thin problem.

Ogx Beauty Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have very fine, thin, long medium-brown hair. This shampoo helps my hair feel fuller. Compared to the coconut kind, this makes my hair feel slightly more weighed down so I alternate between these."

Tresemme 24 Hour Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair,3 / 5,This product is ok. I didn't care for the dry feeling the shampoo left when the product was rinsed from my hair. I felt I had to over compensate with the conditioner in order to achieve soft feeling tresses. When air dried the product left a crunchy residue that would go away once brushed. It's not my favorite product but it's not the worst either.
Tresemme 24 Hour Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo has a nice feeling when I’m done and out of the shower. It does have a beautiful volume with a great scent. The 24 hour volume is accurate. I’ve noticed when I wash my hair it lasts for at least 24 to 48 hours. I don’t like to wash my hair every day. But I do shower everyday. So when I just put it up and style it for the day before. It still looks and feels good. The packaging is perfect when you run the shower and want to use it in your hair. I have really long hair so when I’m using this shampoo and have to put more it it’s easy to add more. Just enough. The end result is fantastic.

Very affordable and you get a good bang for your buck! How long it lasts really just depends on how often you wash your hair. It’s not something I use every wash, so one small container lasted for a good while. It has a sweet smell that’s subtle, not overpowering and stays with your hair all day post wash! It was a little hydrating and helped with frizz for a few days."

Garnier Smoothing Treat 1 Minute Hair Mask + Avocado Extract,5 / 5,I actually got this at the dollar store and have never seen it there since.

Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo is good when your doing lighter colors on your hair such as blonde or silver etc. it keeps it your silver from turning yellowish color from the sun. It helps make your blondes more vibrant and it’s less than $10 at your local beauty store!
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"This purple shampoo is my favorite oldie purple shampoo.. It is very effective and works now you do have to use it right or it will turn your hair purple.. If I need to use it I always leave it on for just like 5-10 mins and rinse.. This is very pigment so it will stain your shower curtain if you don’t remove it after. It does have a scent not sure what the scent is ,but it’s not anything overpowering.. Also if this shampoo isn’t used right it will dry out your hair so I will just use it when needed.. (Maybe use something to help with dryness while using also) Definitely recommend and this is very affordable compared to other brands.."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"I have platinum blond and use this once a week to keep my color icy. I use it first, before my regular shampoo. You definitely need to condition after as it can feel a bit stripping."

Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"Este producto logra eliminar a la perfeccion todos los tonos amarillos de mi cabello para.asi lograr un perfecto tono de blanco, lo cual es muy importante porque pinto mi cabello de colores pasteles."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"This is probably one of the most effective (and well-known) purple shampoos on the market. It works extremely well in removing brassiness. However, you shouldn't use it more than once a week as it can cause dryness. Always follow with a deep conditioner as well. Also note that if you have very light (i.e., level 9 or 10 hair) and you use this frequently it may tint your hair more silvery which is cool if that's what you like!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"Had to get the mini size one for travel as well, because this product is amazing, it those it’s job to clean the scalp as makes your hair look and feel moisturizer"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,"1. BACKGROUND: I used this product from 2016 (summer) to 2018 (fall). My hair is very dark, as I am half Korean, to take me fully blonde it took 2 sessions a week apart (8-12 hrs each) this was done to do as little damage to my hair as possible. (Any unevenness in tone from hair under my ear/base of skull is due to previous bleaching for underlights and color). VIDEO is from 1st session (lost video from second session-red tones are from previous sessions of green/purple/red underlights so it was impossible to go as light as others my go/wish to without EXTREME permanent damage and immediate breakage). 2. REVIEW: This product is very damaging to your hair, my friend has been bleaching her hair for over 12 years, there are much better products. Many people also use this as they believe purple shampoo “kills yellow tones” it helps with orange and BRASSINESS. Use BLUE shampoo if you want to keep more silver/ remove more “yellow tones”. It is cheap, and in images you can see I bleached very light, shimmer lights did kill some brassiness but it did not help as much as blue shampoo would have (it is mis-marketed). Also, after speaking to multiple professional HMUA’s, this is one of the most damaging purple shampoo’s you can purchase. It did more damage overtime and looking back I would have preferred to not use it at all, or use it less than the bottle & brand recommends. My sister has bleached her hair in 2013/14 (underlights and some highlights bordering on an ombré) and a full ombré in 2020 that she occasionally grows out partially then bleaches higher without touching the top which is why the bottle image is small as the bottle is dirty). It has also damaged her hair which is much thicker/denser and darker than mine (she has more curl/Native American recessive genes/and Korean than I do from our mom & great-grandmother-paternal). Regardless we have both suffered more damage from this product and would have used a higher quality, less damaging blue shampoo instead. 3. EDIT: as you can see from my roots in at least 2 images, my hair was a very cool dark brown, commonly mistaken as black (it is not black- my mothers hair is black. In my current profile image I have a lot of red lights that I put some purple dye on- in my profile picture all the bleached hair has been grown out and cut. 4. OTHER INFORMATION: -my hair is lighter from both age & once you bleach the skull your hair will never be as dark as it once was/ the same goes for natural blondes or lighter brunettes if you add darker color to the roots- this is just some extra information I wish I had known at a younger age in case anyone has children/ is looking at products before dying their hair)."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,1 / 5,I did not like this shampoo. I do not think it works at all and it does not smell good. My husband hates it when i use it but i dont want it to go to waste so i still use it but i dont see any difference.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"This is a powerful toning shampoo!! I used to use it every wash but it was very drying and causing quite a bit of damage to my hair. Now I just use it every now and then, or just before going out / to an event. I can leave it in for less than 10 minutes and my hair goes icy blonde and even sometimes a bit purple (which I personally really like)"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,"The purple shampoo really does it’s job, but there is a purple tint to your hair if processed light enough to the point it’s platinum. I know my friend uses it because she likes her hair a light purple color and it works because she is platinum blonde."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"This is my favorite drugstore purple shampoo to use whenever I bleach my hair. It tones the brassiness out of my hair without fail. It is not damaging, smells nice, and lathers beautifully."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"This is great for toning your blonde. I will admit it was a bit drying, but worked great to tone the brassiness when I was blonde."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This is an excellent product to use if you are experiencing brassy or yellow tones to your blonde hair. I use this as a shampoo a few times a week and I also use it on dry hair as a mask. It works perfectly!
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This is the most affordable purple shampoo out there that actually works well. It’s definitely scented but I like the scent.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,1 / 5,"I used this product for a little while because I loved the results it gave me. Little did I know that the entire time I was using it, I was breaking off more hair by the minute. It is so extremely damaging, I switched to the purple shampoo from olaplex!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,2 / 5,"Like my title says, this shampoo tones your hair pretty well. HOWEVER, it makes my hair so dry it is crying for moisture. Wouldn’t really recommend unless you’re in a crunch."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"It's unique and best product that I really love and always want to try, then I found it and have it, now I realize this is the best product i ever used. Try it and see the results. Try and get the best you want. I want to try it again."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo actually works! It brightens my bleached hair so well I went through the entire bottle. It’s very strong and smells great. I usually use once a week. Highly recommend!
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,This was always my go-to purple shampoo as a blonde to remove brassiness and it worked like a charm. I did notice some dryness after having used this but it’s not necessarily for daily use so I never had a problem with that. The scent could definitely use improvement which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"I really enjoyed using this purple shampoo, with other store bought purple shampoos I feel like they have to sit on to tell a different but this one is the opposite it’s fast working and my hair felt nice after using no dryness or irritation definitely recommend!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,this shampoo definitely gets the brassy tones out of blonde hair. if you can get over the smell it is definitely worth it. it does leave the hair feeling very dry (as with most shampoos) but it is overall a good product
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,If you've had an oops and have a little too brassy of hair this is your go to it works great in a few shampoo and doesn't dye your hair
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,’ve purchased many different kinds of hair cleanser/conditioners. I don’t skimp on pricing because you get what you pay for mostly. I’ve been using a name brand for over two years and felt it was time for a change. It was way more costly than this product and I’m shocked at how awesome this product is for the price. They only problem I have now is my hair is so soft a pony tail won’t stay in on day one. This has never been an issue for me.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,2 / 5,I have been using purple shampoo for 12 years now and this is one of the worst ones I have ever tried. It dries out my hair so badly and the purple pigment wasn't strong enough to get rid of the yellow in my hair. I would use a different brand if possible.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,I bought this back when I had silver dye on my hair and it help me with the yellow undertones in my hair. I tried a lot of purple shampoo and found this one worked best for me. My hair is very thin and straight. I found that putting this shampoo before wetting your hair and leaving it for 5-10 minutes (no more than that or your hair will turn purple) will take all of those yellow tones.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,It’s really good to have and a perfect starter if you’re perfecting your blonde. Used after bleaching and while transitioning back to my natural hair. Smaller bottle was good since I use it less frequently now.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This product has a very pleasant smell. I went from yellow orange to blonde platinum in 2 uses. I leave it in my hair for about 15 minutes while I'm doing my other normal hygiene care and when I'm done I rinse it out and use some good conditioner. I love this stuff.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,I used this when I had blonde in my hair to cancel any orange out because of rust water. It works really well and kept my hair the way I wanted it to be so I definitely recommend.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,Took the brasiness away when I bleached my hair then dyed it blonde. Doesn't leave hair too dry and cleanses well. Lasts a long time so I'd recommend
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,Purple shampoo helps my blonde hair shinner and glossy looking. It also helps my hair not look greasy! I rate it 10/10. Perfect for hair!! It keeps my hair looking silky. Best for dry scalp and oily scalp! I am satisfied that it works this good!&nbsp;
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,1 / 5,This was horrible. It dried out my hair and did nothing to color correct. I had to cut all my blond hair off and start fresh with my roots because this destroyed my hair. If I go blond again I will not be using this brand.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,This is a classic for blondes. If you have near white/lightest blonde hair this can dye it lavender. I specifically bought this a year ago to make my hair lavender. You leave it on about 15-20 minutes and you will have lavender/some lavender hues for about 1.5 weeks. I also used this later on as a regular toning shampoo for my blonde hair and it works great. I have tried other purple shampoos that I like better. This is very drying and smells like faint musky cat pee smell with shampoo. Those are my reasons for giving it a 4/5. Of course that scent washes out but it's pretty strong when applying. I think Pravana has the best blonde products.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,I really like this shampoo and it works good!! It smells good and it doesn't stain your scalp or bath tub. It's affordable and you get alot for the price.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,2 / 5,This shampoo did not work for me. It is super watery and didn’t help my hair. Gave off a weird smell and made my hair feel not hydrated at all.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,3 / 5,"Yes, I know that purple shampoo tends to dry out your hair but this one I feel dries it out the MOST. I can appreciate it doing it’s job and removing enough of the brassiness, but I don’t think it’s worth it. No matter what conditioner I use with this shampoo my hair is extra breakable. I’ve switched since then and have had much better luck."
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,Been using this for years and it works every time to remove brassiness from the hair. All you do is shampoo and leave on a few minutes and it's gone.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo smells so good! Leaves your hair silky and shiny. No residue left afterwards. Great for dry scalp.
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,5 / 5,"In the brief moment in time that I had bleached hair, desperately trying to have good-looking blond hair, I used this. It really helped to lift the yellowness out of my hair! I feel like this stuff really worked!"
Shimmer Lights Purple Shampoo for Blonde & Silver Hair,4 / 5,"I purchased this as I highlight my hair and am looking for something to keep it bright and highlights/color looking fresh. I am actually really impressed with this product. My color looks so much better after using but my hair is also super hydrated, soft and silky. After using my husband even asked me if I got my hair done which I did not. I am thinking of just using this full time for my hair as I love it so much. Great product!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Rich lathering shampoo that leaves your hair feeling stronger than ever before. The scent is like no other ans is phenomenal. Helps combat frizz and breakage.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"As a type 4 Natural who has experienced hair loss, im always on the lookout for products that can help repair and strengthen my hair. The Joico K-Pak Hair Line is one that has completely transformed my dry brittle hair. I have to say—it’s a game-changer"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"The shampoo is a restorative one, but we know, right?, that it is not possible to restore hair from shampoo. So why do I take a restorative shampoo? It's simple, I expect the most gentle cleansing from such shampoos, no squeaking of hair and tangling during washing. I need a shampoo that does not turn my hair into a washcloth (yes, shampoos cannot restore hair, but they can certainly worsen its condition). Did Joico K-PAK shampoo live up to my expectations? Yes, and once again, yes! But let's take everything in order. Appearance. Packaging. I have a 300 ml shampoo, so I'll describe it. It is in a gold-colored plastic bottle (typical of the entire restorative line). Nice design, simple but tasteful, one might say in the spirit of professional products. The lid opens easily and closes firmly. Composition and consistency. You can see the composition in the photo. To be honest, I am not very good at compositions, especially in shampoo compositions. It is worth noting that the shampoo contains useful substances: hydrolyzed keratin, evening primrose oil, kukui seed oil... But how effective are these substances in the shampoo, because it is on the hair for literally a few minutes. Nevertheless, thanks to this composition, you can count on gentle hair cleansing. As for the consistency - the shampoo itself is quite thick, creamy. It has a pearlescent color. I would also like to note a very pleasant aroma, it is light, floral, if you smell it directly from the bottle, it seems a little cloying, sweet, but during use I feel only freshness. I can't say whether the aroma of the shampoo remains on the hair, since after that I also use other care products (masks, balms, leave-in products). In principle, there is nothing special about the shampoo, the manufacturer recommends holding the shampoo on your hair for a minute, I did it and then washed it off right away, well, I can’t say that there are any differences in the end. If you have time, then why not hold it on. The shampoo foams well, the first time it may not give a very rich foam, but I always wash my hair twice and the second time the foam turns out great (although the presence of rich foam is not always a guarantee of high-quality cleansing, I have had such shampoos). I apply the shampoo only to the roots, there I whip up the foam (massage) and then rinse it off, that is, the length is washed with just the flowing foam. For me, this method of application is the best, but even if you wash your hair completely with shampoo (I did this a couple of times), the shampoo does nothing bad to your hair, it’s just a matter of habit. I have oily scalp, I wash my hair about once every 2-3 days, the shampoo copes well with pollution, and with this shampoo you don't have to wash your hair more often (this happens with restorative shampoos). As for cleansing, everything is great here) the shampoo gently cleanses the hair, even with quite intensive massage of the roots, the hair does not get tangled, when washing off the shampoo, it seems to smooth out. For me, it is very important that the hair does not get tangled, since then I have to comb it when wet, otherwise I simply will not comb it when dry. Here, I can calmly leave my hair alone after washing and comb it when it is dry. the price is high but it's worth it."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Been on the hunt for a new shampoo will make my hair soft and healthy and hit the jackpot with this one! Lathers super well, love the scent and my hair feels like it’s getting stronger, easier to brush through and is shiny and healthy. I use the conditioner as well and just love how my hair has responded to it. The scent is great too and not overpowering."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,I love smell of this. Leaves hair very shiny. I have a hairstylist friend who immediately knew this was used in my hair from seeing it in person after getting my hair done. The product is on the bigger side but lasts awhile.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,2 / 5,"I have to say I really had high hopes for this! When used, it lathers well but once rinsed, I feel like I need to shampoo again 2 more times. Afterwards my hair is very flat after blow drying with this product."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,3 / 5,"I have curly, dry, frizzy hair that needs moisture. I have used this shampoo and conditioner several times over the years. It does smooth your hair but in my opinion, it weighs my hair down too much to where it’s just flat after being styled."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been using Joico hair care products for years. I honestly don’t have a single negative thing to say about their products! I have very long hair & it has been every color imaginable but yet my hair is in excellent shape due to Joico products. The permanent hair color & the K-pack shampoo/conditioner duo keep my hair soft, shiny but most importantly-healthy!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,It was a nice shampoo to use when I was coloring my hair. It seemed to help add hydration back into it. It was decently priced for the effectiveness of the product.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Shampoo che oltre a detergere la cute in modo delicato, offre al capello un’adeguata e mirata ricostruzione delle parti danneggiate lasciandolo molto morbido e idratato . Profumo fantastico !!!! La Texture è molto cremosa e ne basta una piccola quantità da diluire con un po’ di acqua per una miglior distribuzione."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,The k-pak line is now my HG! This shampoo cleanses my bleached blonde hair so well and my hair is now so soft. Good for curly hair and i recommend the clarifying shampoo as well
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and you only need to use a small amount to get a good lather. I use both the shampoo and conditioner. I have course, thick, wavy long hair and this gives smoothness and shine."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been bleaching my hair consistently for about 4 years so to find a shampoo that not only makes the hair look good, but feel softer too is AMAZING! In love with the Joico K-Pak"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,With this product my hair shine and not frizzy. The shampoo is soft and not aggressive for hair. The price versus the quality is very good. I recommend this product for every type of hair
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Absolutely love this shampoo & conditioner. It was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I have pretty damaged hair from constantly using box dye and she told me about this shampoo and conditioner and it seems to be working 🙂
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"I am thrilled to write a five-star review for Joico K-PAK shampoo. As someone who regularly bleaches their hair every 1-3 months, I have been on a constant search for a product that could repair and restore my damaged hair. Joico K-PAK shampoo has been a game-changer in my hair care routine. From the moment I first used this shampoo, I could tell that it was different from any other shampoo I had tried before. Its rich, creamy texture felt luxurious and nourishing on my hair, and the scent was absolutely divine. But what really impressed me was how it transformed my hair over time. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and overall health of my hair. It felt softer, smoother, and more manageable than ever before. And with continued use, my hair has become stronger and more resilient, even after frequent bleaching. I love that this shampoo is formulated with Joico's exclusive Bio-Advanced Peptide Complex, which helps to repair and protect damaged hair. It also contains a blend of antioxidants and vitamins that nourish and strengthen hair from the inside out. Overall, I can't recommend Joico K-PAK shampoo enough. If you have damaged or chemically treated hair like mine, this product is an absolute must-have. It has been crucial in repairing and restoring my hair, and I will continue to use it as a staple in my hair care routine. Five stars all around!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"My hair was in such bad shape, after going to the salon and getting this shampoo recommended, my hair was saved. My hair is softer, so shiny, and overall healthier. I feel like my color lasts longer also but that may just be in my head. Either way it’s my go to shampoo now. I can’t recommend enough if you’re in the market for a new shampoo."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Worked great on my frizz and smells amazing would definitely repurchase. The conditioner is also very great! Keratin treatment who! We don’t need that here. :)
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"LOVE. Love the smell, love how it leaves my hair feeling, love how easy it is to saturate and spread. There will never be a time this isn't in my arsenal for use."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Joico’s K-Pak line is amazing. I’ve been using the shampoo & conditioner for over a decade now (off and on cause I love to try new things as well). The K-Pak line has never failed me and I used to fry my hair like it was an egg on a skillet, with bleach. This line has saved my hair many times and kept it in good condition after chemical treatments, etc. This is something I recommend to anyone who says they have damaged hair. It smells really nice too! I’ve grown attached to the scent cause I’ve used Joico K-Pak for so many years now!"
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,4 / 5,Very moisturizing and my hair feels great after using it. I don’t use it every time I wash my hair just cz it can weigh it down but I do like to use it every other wash.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Use this Joico shampoo with conditioner and it works great for my damaged hair. I bought this product probably the third time and very happy with it. My hair looks great.
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,"Joico is one of the better brands out there for the professional. I can say that the smell is far better than many shampoo and conditions available. It has a nice light clean smell, without the heavy perfumes. Biolage always reminds me of weeds and I avoid like the plague. K-Pak was designed for repair and does just that. It will feel heavier on hair and if you tend to have oily hair, it's probably not for you. With the conditioner, avoid the scalp. But then again, if you have dry or damaged hair, you probably aren't having issues with oily hair. As with all professional products, buy from a professional and ask for advice. This is a superior brand and works as it's meant to. I highly recommend."
Joico K-PAK Shampoo,5 / 5,Smells so good !!! Makes your shower a nice treat when it smells this good. Your hair will feel super soft and moisturized with just this shampoo - highly recommend

In addition to visibly restoring hair from the first use, the line still smells wonderful.

I have bleached hair and only Joico products recover from chemical damage. If you are insecure, you can buy without fear. if you prefer, buy a travel size to do a test because you will be surprised"

L'Oreal Paris Moisture Sulfate Free Shampoo for Dry Hair,5 / 5,"Here’s a sample review for a sulfate-free L’Oréal shampoo: L’Oréal Paris EverPure Sulfate-Free Shampoo Review I’ve been using the L’Oréal EverPure Sulfate-Free Shampoo for a few weeks now, and I’m absolutely impressed! My hair tends to be on the drier side, so I always look for gentle, nourishing formulas, and this shampoo delivered. The sulfate-free formula feels incredibly gentle on my scalp while still providing a thorough cleanse. It doesn’t strip my hair of its natural oils, which is such a relief. After every wash, my hair feels softer, more manageable, and noticeably shinier. I also love the subtle, luxurious scent—floral with a hint of freshness. It’s not overwhelming but leaves my hair smelling amazing all day. Plus, the fact that it’s free of harsh sulfates makes it a great choice for color-treated or sensitive hair. The only downside is that it doesn’t lather as much as shampoos with sulfates, but that’s totally expected with sulfate-free products. It still cleans effectively, so it’s a small adjustment that’s worth it for healthier. Great value for the money it cost."

The scent is wonderful, it doesn’t disturb. The shampoo surely does its job - my scalp and hair feel fresh and clean. The only thing that I noticed as a downside is that I wouldn’t use it alone, because hair might feel dry. You definitely need to pair it with a conditioner. I used to use it with leave-ins, and the effect was amazing. But several times I used it on its own, and that’s when my hair started to feel a bit dry. So my advice would be to use it in combination with other products."

Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,5 / 5,"I suffer from dry scalp in the winter. The typical itchy and sometimes flaky scalp. I also want to mention that I get really oily roots and have hair down to my butt. With that being said I don’t often find products that soothe my scalp without making it oily and keep my ends from taking too much damage. This seems to be a winner! The eucalyptus smells great (I like the earthy plant smells) and feels nice too. When I rinse it, it doesn’t make my ends feel like hay (some other brands do) and it gives you the added bonus of a slight tingle on the scalp. If you haven’t tried this brand or type you should. It’s done wonders for me! I will mention that the directions ask you to leave it in for a few minutes and if I immediately wash it out as you would a regular shampoo, I don’t get the same results. So having the patience to let it sit almost like a conditioner is key here."

Because of how cleansing it is, I like to pair it with a hair mask or a deep conditioner."

I recommend!"
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo is something that I will never switch back from. The feeling it gives to your scalp while also cleaning all the grime at the same time is amazing. I love this shampoo so much!
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my all time favorite shampoo! It volumizes, helps my hair tangle not so much and it smells great! Only downside is the price but it’s definitely worth it for me"

Tea Tree Special Shampoo,4 / 5,I've used this shampoo before i started getting Brazilian blowouts; can't anymore because it has sulfates. it smells really good and is very moisturizing. Great product!
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,Best shampoo I ever use I got the tea tree shampoo it has peppermint tea oil and lavender! Gives a tingling sensation! Love it
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is amazing! My hairdresser has been using it on my hair for as long as I can remember. I took it home & used it but I don't remember the extremely strong smell. The smell is amazing but it smells more of a strong peppermint than tea tree oil. You will definitely pay a good price for the bottles no matter the size but it's worth it! It makes my hair smell so good all day, makes my hair shiny & clean, & glad there is a matching conditioner. But I only use it once a month when I want a really good cleanse as the smell makes me a little dizzy in the shower. I bought mine from Ulta for $16.50!"
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,3 / 5,"Another love/hate affair for me...I like this one because it does actually help reduce my oily scalp and calms my scalp down (probably due to the Tea Tree oil in it), however the dislike is because it's slightly on the harsh side, which is definitely due to the fact that it contains SLS. Rarely does my hair like any shampoo that contains this ingredient, as I end up with hair that feels 'stripped' clean and dry, and not in a good sense! It also contains too much Menthol, and too much peppermint oil - straight out of Pureology's Hydrate Shampoo books. Both brands' shampoos have Peppermint Oil at 6th place in the ingredients list, although unlike Pureology, I don't find my scalp itching as much after using Paul Mitchell's. It also foams less and smells quite refreshing and more natural. However I wouldn't use this long term simply because it doesn't agree with my hair and I end up having to use a hair mask weekly to try and restore my hair to its pre-shampoo state.

Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,I will even add several drops of 100% Tea Tree OIL to the shampoo to get a real nice feeling all over my scalp and let it site for a few minutes. Hair feel clean and dries nicely. Dandruff and that itchiness when it gets hot outside and your scalp sweats comes to an end.
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have struggled with my scalp a lot so I decided to give this a go. I usually have issues with build up and some products end up feeling like they never washed out. This made my hair feel soft, my scalp was less irritated and flaky, so I would say it was a good experience! I only use this maybe once a week or more. I don't use it everyday. I'd say this is a good support to my normal washing routine. Hair type: I have fine strands and thick hair."

Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love the Tea Tree Special Shampoo for the smell and the mint. I always use it for my headaches because the cooling of the mint on my scalp just makes my heqd qnd hair feel better.

He really likes this product to get rid of all the flakes and dirt without totally drying his scalp or even further. It helps soothe his skin a little bit too.
Tea Tree Special Shampoo,5 / 5,"Unfortunately with the cold weather my scalp gets super dry. Always happens with every winter & every time it does I use this shampoo.

"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",5 / 5,"I love the scent! I thought it would’ve smelled strongly of apple cider vinegar, but it smells just like apples.

"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",3 / 5,"I started the new year with a resolution to go more earth friendly, so I am trying this shampoo and conditioner. I only wash my hair once a week because I don't have alot of natural oil in my skin and scalp. Most shampoo and conditioners I use leave my hair unmanageable. I am hoping this one is different. It felt different using it, meaning the lather was thicker and the conditioner more easily spread over my hair. So as for now, I give it three stars. I will be back after a second or third use to amend my review if necessary."
"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",5 / 5,This is a great shampoo. My daughter has very fine oily hair and this shampoo helps prevent her hair from getting so oily throughout the day. It doesn't have a strong vinegar smell and it has a good texture. I would highly recommend this to anyone with fine oily hair.
"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",5 / 5,"The smell of this shampoo is incredible! The apple fragrance is spot on. Its bottle claims that it ""removes dulling residue"", as a detox shampoo should, and it definitely delivers. I try not to wash my hair too frequently, so dry shampoo is my best friend in between washes. This magically strips the built-up products off my hair without drying it out. Also, I appreciate that it is 98% plant-derived and cruelty-free. Consuming better, more sustainable products is a priority for me, and this fits the bill perfectly."

"Live Clean Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, 12 oz. Bottle",5 / 5,I love the fact that it is a clean product with no chemicals that affect your body and you. It lathers pretty good. There's not much of lather but it does its job. I have a dry scalp so I would say it did not affect me in a negative way. I would buy again.

Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,3 / 5,Works well to keep my grey hair from turning brassy. I use only once every week or two since it does tend to dry out you hair. Not overly expensive so it won’t break the bank.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this purple shampoo. I have tried many others and none of them have given me the results I’ve been looking for. This shampoo tones my hair very well.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,2 / 5,"This purple shampoo did not hold up to the Joico quality that I am used to seeing when using their products. I love the Joice K-Pak conditioner because you can see instant results in your hair, but not the case for the Purple shampoo. I feel like I wasted a lot of product and received no results: instantly or over time. I currently have very light bleached blonde hair with extensions, and while the shampoo did give a tint to the extensions, it did nothing for my natural hair sadly. I have also used the Blue shampoo which worked a little better when I had darker blonde highlights, but the purple for lighter blondes is a no-go."
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best purple shampoo out of all the tried! Makes even virgin hair so ashy. Love how deep purple the shampoo actually is. Good amount for the amount you buy.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"This purple shampoo made my hair hold the blonde better than any other! Never seemed to damage my hair when using Atleast 1 times a week. My hair stayed strong, smelled great and all in all I have zero complaints."
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,4 / 5,I’m a huge Joico fan and I review this brand a lot. They have products in their line to target any hair needs that you have. I have bleached blonde hair which is definitely not forgiving of any damage. My natural color is a light blonde so the lift wasn’t too extreme. It does however get that brassy tone after the color process which is typical. This is the strong Barney purple that I use right after color processing. One use makes a huge and noticeable difference right away. I only leave it on for 5 minutes tops or else the purple will stick to hair. It’s not good when you think you’ve done a good job of rinsing only to find some random purple after you’ve dried your hair. Depending on the condition of your hair you definitely don’t ever need to leave it on for more than five minutes and twice a week tops. It’s not usually necessary. It has an average scent so that’s not a selling point. This shampoo has really one pain purpose in my opinion so I don’t see it as adding any shine or softening benefits. I do recommend this only if your hair is what it’s targeted to.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"The only purple shampoo that I trust to use on my hair! Tones brassiness and leaves your hair looking and feeling fabulous! 10/10 from me, great product"

Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo! My hairstylist recommended it for me ever since I started regularly dying my hair blonde.

Obviously remember not to let it sit for a long time or it will turn lilac but if you have lavender hair I think this would also be a great product to keep it in color!"
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,I started using this new shampoo for my blonde and let me say I absolutely love it. I haven’t seen any brassiness on my hair nor yellow tones.

Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,This stuff smells so good and it works really well too! I can tell when I switch between shampoos the difference this one makes.
Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo,2 / 5,"I have medium to light(ish) blonde hair, that tends to brass up pretty quickly. I purchased Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo with the hopes that my brassiness would disappear after at least a couple washes.

Instead, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy, with a beautiful shine. I also appreciate the convenience of the packaging. The bottle is easy to use, with a flip-top cap that allows for precise pouring and prevents any spills or messes.

L'Oreal Paris Brass Toning Purple Sulfate Free Shampoo,5 / 5,"I had never tried this shampoo/conditioner set before but in looking for purple one--those made specifically for blonde, silver and gray hair--I ran across this and decided to try it. My (now-white) hair has always been dry but even though I do not blow dry it I still feel it is on the dry side. It has also gotten a bit frizzy. This doesn't leave my hair as soft as I would like but I think it does a pretty fine job, hence four stars for moisturizing and softness. I do tend to rinse thoroughly so perhaps I am doing a bit too much. The scent is minimal, thank goodness, because I loathe scented/perfumed products of any kind. And my hair gets and looks wonderfully clean. Recommended."

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"I really liked using Olaplex shampoo. It worked well for my hair, leaving it clean, smooth, and moisturized without stripping it. One bottle lasted me about two months since I wash my hair every other day and usually rinse 2-3 times. I used it for around six months, and I noticed my hair felt stronger and shinier. The scent is subtle and pleasant, not overpowering, which I liked. The packaging is simple but practical, with a pump that makes it easy to control how much you use. As for the value for money, it’s a bit pricier compared to regular shampoos, but I think it’s worth it if you’re looking for a product that really helps with hair health. The ingredients are solid—designed to strengthen and repair, which is why I kept using it for so long. I did stop using it after my hairstylist suggested switching things up now and then, but I’d definitely consider going back to it."
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"Started using this because this was what my hair stylist used on me when I got my hair done.

Highly recommend!"
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"I switched to Olaplex about a year ago and will never go back. The shampoo smells great, really cleans my hair, and is super concentrated which means a little truly goes a long way.

If you don’t have enough lather, add more water instead of more product."
No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo. It only takes a quarter size amount and lathers really well. It smells fresh without being too overbearing. I also like the packaging.

No. 4 Bond Maintenance™ Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo may seem pricey, but you honestly get way more out of it than typical shampoo. My hair is just above hip length, and I only use a quarter sized amount because it lathers up so well! My hair only has a small section that’s been bleached so it’s not super damaged, but I do think it really helps smooth the bleached parts whenever it’s starting to look a little dry and frazzled! I use this shampoo every other wash and use a clarifying shampoo in between. If you have flawless hair this shampoo isn’t going to do anything for you, but it’s great if you have any damage! I also really like the scent of this product. It’s light and smells clean. The packaging is nice and simple and the texture of the shampoo is creamy smooth."

I've seen lots of people talk about this shampoo and some say good things and some negative, but it's all on how it's used.. its not meant to be used as an every day shampoo. But everyone's hair type is different and some people could probably get away with using it every day or at every hair washing day, and for some it might be to harsh it all just depends. For me personally I've never experienced any negative things about this shampoo. The only thing is that it doesn't lather very much and I've tried massaging it in my palms first before massaging it onto my scalp and hair. If you use it correctly and what's it meant for it can be a great product to have. The conditioner is like any other, nothing spectacular and keeps my ends moisturized enough"

Jamaican Black Castor Oil Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"[product:jamaican-black-castor-oil-bentonite-clay-shampoo-bar] ￼is one of my favorite things I’ve come across. I’m rating this product 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because I love to use this as a shaving bar. I use it on my pits, legs and elsewhere to get a smooth, close and moisturized shave. 🪒 I did try this one time as a shampoo like it’s marketed and it left my hair feeling how you’d think a bar shampoo would feel. Dry and stripped. This may be a great eco friendly option for bathing while camping or backpacking or staying out in the woods for any reason and having to bathe. It does make it feel clean but a weird film on top of the hair. That’s not at all how this feels on the skin while shaving though. I’m not sure that this is something I’ll continue buying as a shave bar but it does last a while so if it’s on sale sometime at Ulta again then I may buy it again."

Suave Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my FAVORITE dry shampoo when I can find it! I have coarse, curly hair - I also have a 9-month-old, so I don’t always have the time to give my hair the love it needs. This stuff is a lifesaver when my roots start getting oily but my ends can’t take a wash yet, and it takes less than two minutes to apply. My curls LOVE the keratin. And since Suave products always have that luxurious salon smell, just for those two minutes, I get to escape and pamper myself. 💆🏼‍♀️"

Suave Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my holy grail dry shampoo. I mean it. If you can get your hands on some of this, buy as many cans as possible, because its currently discontinued. It's extremely effective at absorbing oil while also making your hair soft. Doesnt weigh down hair or make it brittle. Can be used on freshly washed & dried hair to add volume that lasts. BUT THE SMELL, OH MY GOD. IT SMELLS INCREDIBLE. Every single time that I've ever used it in front of other people--especially men--they've made a comment about how good it smells. Ive even used it just to scent my hair when I wasn't oily at all. All the other Suave dry shampoos are just average but this specific one, the Keratin Infusion in a gold can with an orange label, is intoxicating."

Absolutely cannot get enough of it. When it came time then to buy some new shampoo, wouldn't you know, I bought the coconut smell because that's what I like. The shampoo seemingly works (I haven't developed any odd rashes, noticed my hair to be any more dry/oily or any other real changes) and I think Suave did a nice job with making the coconut smell sweet but not overbearing. Seeing as how I really like the scent, I'd probably continue to buy it again and again and again. I like it"

Pureology Strength Cure Shampoo,5 / 5,Love this! Been using it for years. It is expensive! But I bleach my hair mostly so I can't really gripe about having to spend extra on good hair products. Scent is super nice. You can smell it for days! I would recommend making sure you really really wash out all of the conditioner before you finish because it will give you a greasy head. And also blow dry most of your hair after. If not it gets waxy feeling and oily looking. But I guarantee you if you use it they way I do it will blow your mind. I have literal bleach blonde barbie hair all over and it looks do healthy and perfect that it could almost pass as a wig. Lol and of course that means a good hairstylist as well but after years of bleaching I know the only way to keep it looking salon fresh is with this shampoo and conditioner. I won't change it!

No matter what I did - my hair was itchy, oily and just a mess a day after washing. This has saved my hair!! I only wash my hair twice a week at night the most and my hair looks great! When you have dark hair, like I do, oil and flakes are way more prominent. I was constantly embarrassed by my hair. Purchasing this was the best thing I ever did.

The result is a noticeably cleaner and more balanced scalp, which has been a game-changer for me, especially in combating dryness and flakiness. What sets this product apart is its gentle yet effective formula. Despite its powerful exfoliation, it doesn’t leave my scalp feeling irritated or stripped. Instead, it provides a soothing, invigorating experience thanks to its blend of natural ingredients like charcoal and coconut oil, which help nourish and hydrate. The fragrance is another highlight. It has a refreshing, clean scent that lingers without being overpowering. Plus, the scrub’s texture is perfect—not too harsh, but just right to provide an excellent scrub without any discomfort. Overall, the Briogeo Exfoliating Scalp Scrub is a fantastic investment for anyone looking to enhance their scalp health. It delivers on its promises, leaving my scalp refreshed and my hair feeling lighter and more manageable. It’s a treat for both the senses and the scalp, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their hair care routine."
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,3 / 5,Does it actually help? I'm not so sure.... I think the idea is great and the product feels fresh and nice... but the amount of the exfoliant doesn't really reach much of your scalp. Some areas manage if you're hair isn't too thick
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"The Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo by Briogeo is designed to deeply cleanse the scalp and gently exfoliate the skin, promoting a healthy and buildup-free scalp. It features activated charcoal, coconut oil, and micro-exfoliating particles in its formulation. Key Ingredients Activated Charcoal: Helps attract and remove impurities, excess oil, and residue from the scalp. Coconut Oil: Provides essential nutrients and helps maintain moisture. Salicylic Acid: Exfoliates the scalp and helps prevent dead skin cell buildup. Peppermint Oil: Offers a refreshing sensation and may help stimulate circulation in the scalp. User Experience Texture and Application: The shampoo has a gel-like texture with small exfoliating particles that dissolve as you apply it. The formula spreads easily and creates a light foam.

The exfoliation is gentle, making it suitable for frequent use without causing irritation. Effectiveness Cleansing: The shampoo effectively cleanses the scalp, removing product residue and excess oil without leaving it feeling stripped or dry. Exfoliation: The exfoliating particles provide a soft yet effective exfoliation, removing dead skin cells and promoting a healthier scalp.

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"I get really bad dry scalp, so I am all about scalp scrubs! I received this Beiogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-exfoliating Scalp Scrub complimentary from Briogeo. This is such a cool scrub as it is also a shampoo. I suffer from dry, flaky scalp, so I’m always on the hunt for scalp products. 🥥 Briogeo Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-exfoliating Scalp Scrub contains charcoal, coconut oil, tea-tree and mint oils. It’s so heavenly on my scalp! It starts out as a gentle exfoliator with dissolvable granules and when applied and massaged in, becomes a rich lather. It leaves my scalp and hair feeling so fresh and clean and works wonderfully with all my Briogeo hair masks. I’m a bit obsessed. 🥥"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"If you use as much dry shampoo as I do, or if you have a dry scalp, this is a must in your hair care routine! Opening the container you can smell the tea tree oil, peppermint and spearmint. I knew this was going to be a great shampoo/scalp scrub! The shampoo is easy to apply and work from scalp to ends. The lather is amazing! I wasn’t expecting to like this shampoo as much as I do. It removes buildup, oil and dirt and nourishes the scalp. Love this shampoo! This is good for all hair types and texture. It is a clean product that packs a punch! Will become an item in my hair care products! ✅ Clean + Planst Aware ✅Cruelty Free, ✅Vegan ✅Gluten Free"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"Briogeo has truly impressed me with this shampoo! As someone who values clean, natural, and effective beauty products, this shampoo ticks all the boxes. The micro-exfoliating formula is gentle, yet effective and helps to promote a healthier scalp! Briogeo products are all about clean beauty - they are vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free, which aligns perfectly with my values. l've noticed an improvement in the health of my scalp since incorporating this product into my routine!

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"I have started using this recently and noticed it cleanses the scalp really well.

Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,5 / 5,"So, while I don't have dandruff, my hair gets super greasy. I don't use a lot of hair products besides the normal shampoo and conditioner. Upon opening the tub, you get a strong whiff of a minty scent. It's not horrible but noticeable. I got my hair wet with cool water before applying the product. I used my scalp brush to massage it into my scalp. The first time, it didn't really lather up, but the second wash was a little better. I left the second wash on for a couple of minutes while I shaved, washed, etc. Then, I applied a moisturizing volume conditioner. I have to say my hair was noticeably softer once it dried. My hair didn't start looking greasy until day three. Normally, it's looking greasy the next day. I do have to say there needs to be an easier way to apply it. Having to scoop up the product can lead to a mess, and it's just a pain in general. I think I'll use this once a week for a hair reset!"
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"Starting with the outcome, I do not think this worked in getting rid of dandruff. I had more success in using a clarifying shampoo in getting rid of my dandruff long term than with this product. The results I think I did get: I think this scrub helped as a short term solution in helping to remove dandruff (not the root cause) and exfoliate the scalp. My husband and I both used it, and I think the amount required for short hair was also much more manageable than the amount I felt was required for my long hair - even applying it just at the scalp. It takes a lot of product to really get it in there and scrub. I did think the scent was nice as well."
Briogeo Scalp Revival™ Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo | Scalp Scrub,4 / 5,"It smelled minty and your scalp feels fresh after using it. I like using it when I feel like I have a lot of product buildup from dry shampoo, heat protectant, etc."

Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,Je vous suggère d acheter ce produit c est tellement bon vous allez venir par ici pour me remercier et aussi vous faire comme moi c’est dure de témoigner l efficacité et de ce produit
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Smells great and left my hair feeling clean and silky. Half the time I buy shampoos, I feel like they are all the same ingredients, but use different labels, but shampoos like this prove me wrong. Pros- - Smells great - Thick, silky smooth texture feels great on hair - Didn't require much for a rich lather Cons- - Can't think of any!"
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel so clean and soft. After a blow dry the smell lingers and stays for a while. I’m love how my it conditions my split ends and prolongs salon visits for trims
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,4 / 5,"This works well on my oily scalp and dry strands. Cleans effectively without stripping the nutrients so can use daily. Hair feels soft and smooth after usage. A small amount foams up into a decent size. Scent is a little overpowering, especially while lathering it in. Hair seems stronger and I've start seeing less breakage while brushing or putting it up. Affordable price."
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,3 / 5,"Den her shampoo er faktisk ret god. Mit hår er ret følsomt over for shampoo og normalt må jeg bruge de ret dyrere mærker, fordi mit hår er så stort og kraftigt. Men den her har overrasket mig, jeg bruger den sammen med den tilhørende balsam hver anden dag. Og topper med hårkuren hver 4. Dag. Mit hår er rent og blødt.. og så er det rart, at man altid kan finde det her brand på tilbud. Indpakningen, emballagen er fin men låget går nemt i stykker, hvilket er lidt irriterende, for shampoo kan ikke stå uden låg."
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this company, the smell is amazing and my hair is so shiny after I use it. The package is pretty and fits nicely next to the conditioner. The texture my hair has is silky smooth and it doesn’t get greasy overnight like other shampoos."
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,Very gentle yet effective product. It’s super affordable and a deal because the bottle is huge. Its ingredients are good as well and it’s refreshing

Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"J'ai récemment essayé le Shampooing Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10, et je suis absolument ravi des résultats. Ce produit a surpassé mes attentes à bien des égards. Tout d'abord, la formule est incroyablement nourrissante. Dès la première utilisation, j'ai remarqué une différence significative dans la texture de mes cheveux. Ils étaient plus doux, plus lisses et incroyablement faciles à coiffer. La formule Pro-V semble vraiment fonctionner en profondeur pour revitaliser les cheveux de l'intérieur, laissant une sensation de fraîcheur et de légèreté. Un autre point fort est l'odeur divine de ce shampooing. Le parfum est frais, subtil et dure longtemps sur les cheveux. C'est une expérience sensorielle agréable à chaque utilisation, et cela ajoute définitivement à l'ensemble de l'expérience du lavage des cheveux. Ce que j'apprécie particulièrement avec le Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10, c'est sa polyvalence. Comme son nom l'indique, il offre 10 bienfaits en un seul produit. Mes cheveux semblent plus forts, plus hydratés, et l'éclat naturel est accentué. Cela simplifie considérablement ma routine capillaire quotidienne. Le Shampooing Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 est un produit exceptionnel qui tient ses promesses. Si vous recherchez un shampooing qui prend soin de vos cheveux de manière complète tout en offrant une expérience agréable, je vous recommande vivement d'essayer celui-ci. Mes cheveux n'ont jamais été aussi sains et beaux"
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,Normally I use all the Pantene products and like them all including the smell. The texture of my hair after using it’s perfect! My hair is thin so I need to pay attention on the products
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I like this shampoo. My hair is very soft after using it. Good scent. Price is affordable, I will buy it again for sure. I recommended it to my friends"
Pantene Pro-V Ultimate 10 Shampoo,5 / 5,En mo personal es un sampa oo qué siempre me a encantado lo uso ya hace muchísimo tiempo y me gusta cono me deja me cabello la verdad es super recomendable
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"If you’re looking for a great cleansing shampoo this is great for my natural girls. I have type 4a hair texture. However, I have a sister whose 4c and it works great for both of up. You get a lot of product and the smell is really pleasant. I spent about $13 on it and it lasted me a while."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I was a little skeptical about shampooing my starter locs in general but when I came across this product and product reviews I decided to give it a try. I loved it the tip of the bottle made it so easy to be able to penetrate my scalp, my hair smells amazing, & It was perfect to get the built up dirt, oils, and mostly edge control out of my hair. I will be continuing to use this product through my loc journey."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This is definitely a clarifying shampoo. It will get the dirt and debris out. Liquid to foam action is on point. It lasted me a while so it is well worth the money. It is also a really big bottle of shampoo. Has the light scent also. I do recommend. Already have a backup!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I really do like it, it does the job nicely. It’s a bit drying but it’s recommended that you use a deep conditioning afterward and the problem is gone. Does not dry the hair at the end of the routine and has a really nice scent to it."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! A little goes a long way! It doesn’t make my hair feel stripped and dried out! It leaves my hair soft and moisturized! And my curls always look amazing after I use this shampoo ! Definitely recommend if u have curly hair!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"Ce shampooing clarifiant est très efficace, le flacon à bec permet de faire pénétrer le shampooing là où vous en avez besoin et il mousse bien. Ce shampooing est très décapant, il est donc préférable de l'utiliser une fois par mois ou deux fois si nécessaire."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I love this stuff! I use it on my wash days and I kept it in my routine! It smells delicious. Doesn’t matter what scent you get, this gives you the clean that you’re looking for. I suggest you try it."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,I use this shampoo on my Sisterlocks and does a great job at getting them clean. I love the nozzle on the bottle which is great for easy application. The price point is not bad on the pockets.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I love this shampoo! However after using it my hair does feel really dry, but that’s because it really clarifies my scalp and gets rid of any build up. It lathers really nicely and smells absolutely incredible."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I consistently struggle to find shampoo that works for my hair. I picked this up about a month ago to try something new and I will never use another shampoo. It works great! For me, it works a little like a clarifying shampoo but doesn’t completely strip my hair. The aloe really helps protect and keep a bit of moisture. There is a light fragrance to the shampoo, but it’s not heavy and overpowering. Note to others: This shampoo is the consistency of water and doesn’t really lather. There is a pointed tip to help get a more even application over your scalp and hair. I also use a scalp massager to help work it into my scalp and roots. I rinse with cool water and follow up with my favorite conditioner."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,3 / 5,"It's not bad, but it definitely seems like more of a clarifying shampoo. It cleaned my hair really well, but unfortunately left it feeling stripped and kind of dry. This is not a shampoo I would use everyday, maybe more like once a week just to get rid of product build up. The scent is very strong and stays in your hair."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This is the product I didn't know I needed. Simply, this is a clarifying shampoo with a targeted applicator to make sure you get this on the scalp. It layers up quickly and removes build up from the scalp. I would not recommend using this for a double wash because it will make your scalp and hair so dry! Use this, then use your usual shampoo to do the second wash, do your regular conditioning routine and you won't regret it! This leaves my oily scalp SO clean and does a much better job than a double wash with even the best shampoos. If you have issues with build up, oily scalp, dandruff, etc, you need this. I have seborrheic dermatitis and this clears it up and extends my time between washes. By the way, I have fine and straight hair and I use this once a week or every other week."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,3 / 5,"This shampoo made my hair feels squeaky and dry, which contributed to frizzy hair once it dried. I would not recommend this product to those with 3b curls like mine."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I have a hard time finding products for fine curly hair but this is perfect!! Weightless, cleans really well, helps my curls!!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"After getting a keratin treatment and dying my hair my 3A curls turned more wavy and it’s been tough getting them to curl again. I have thin, low porosity, 3A hair, and had a lot of product build up and damage after keratin and using dye; I tried other clarifying shampoos and they weren’t as good as this one I feel like this felt like it really removed everything from my hair and makes me feel like I’m starting fresh. If you don’t have that much product build up it it might be too stripping and dry it out so if you do get this make sure to use it once a month or around there to ensure you’re not drying out your hair. For my people who build up product in their hair easily this is going to be great every couple week or month to get the build up out! Especially us with low porosity."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I have very long, curly hair and this is one of my favorite shampoos to use. The scent is great and the product keeps my hair soft and manageable while keeping my curls hydrated. I love this brand and their products!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,3 / 5,"I have very wavy hair and had never tried a water to foam shampoo before. But this did not lather as much as I’d like, and didn’t leave my hair feeling washed."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,Absolutely love and cannot go a day without it. It has become part of my routine and always makes me feel brand new and HEALTHY!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I found Carol's Daughter haircare line during COV19 at Dollar General and Walmart. I tried both scents of cowash, a rose scent and then this one, aloe vera scent. I was searching for a product to remove buildup from my scalp and help with dullness I was experiencing from a very expensive haircare line. These formulas for shampoo are EXCELLENT for under $12.00 I did not necessarily use because of curly hair, these both work well on curly wavy or straight hair, as my daughter also used for over a month. I prefer the Rose scent and results. Although both are a clear light water then transform to a foam as you circle into your scalp. These products remove all build up and leave your hair so light feeling you will definitely immediately notice a difference with the first wash. My shine was restored after first use. My hair feels so soft, not weighed down at all, and so healthy. I only need to wash with this product once per week. These two items have helped my overall hair growth goals immensely. I would definetly recommend these two cowash items and add them to your rotation of haircare products. I have finished 4 bottles after several months and I am so impressed with the quality, results, at a budget price. [product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-with-rose-water] [product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-for-curly-hair]"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This product has been amazing for the overall texture of my hair. Since using this product, my hair has become much softer and healthier. I love the application tip and how well it rids the scalp of build up. I have psoriasis that affects the scalp and this product is extremely soothing. It also doesn’t contain a slew of chemicals and is affordable."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"So first off- my hair isn't really curly. It's thick, wavy, and color treated. I loved the applicator tip because I could get the wash to where I needed it easily. I only opened it part way so it wouldn't come out too fast. In the shower, it was pretty drying. To the extent that if you have dry hair, I don't think I'd recommend it. It feels like a clarifying shampoo. It has a strong citrus scent, which was pleasant, but if you're sensitive to citrus oils it could be problematic. HOWEVER my hair came right back to life after conditioner (I just used cheap garnier fructis tbh). When my hair dried it felt so clean and soft, honestly better than I've had it with most other shampoos (I feel like with other shampoo I'm always left with oily or waxy residue). Also, it didn't seem to take very much color out of my hair (a big plus in my book)."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"C A R O L .. Come her and Bring your DAUGHTER ! Not only is this shampoo easy to administer directly to your scalp , it’s Water to Sud formulation is PERFECT! I love the light Aloe smell & how it leaves your hair feeling Clean but not brittle !"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,1 / 5,I have thick 4c hair that’s about ear to neck length when stretched and major shrinkage when dry. I tried to edit my original review via the app but the app wasn’t letting me. So I will be posting a new review. I bought this again for the 2nd time since it’s worked for me before. This time around my hair does not seem to like it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or if since I’ve been getting my hair professionally taken care my hair has changed. Either way every time I use it now my hair is like straw. There’s no more slip and if not delicate easily can tear and break my strands. It’s unfortunate. This time around I bought the set that comes with the conditioner. Tbh the conditioner is the only saving grace it brings the slip back after the shampoo dried my hair out. I won’t be using this again and will be trying other things that could work.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,2 / 5,I wash my hair in twists to minimize the tangles. The pointed nozzle is perfect to get product straight onto my scalp. On the downside. This is marketed as a clarifying shampoo and it did no such this.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo, males my hair feel clean and not stripped or dry. I’m currently on my second bottle and will continue to buy this, it’s so affordable."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"Although it recommended for braids, I love the feel and smell of this shampoo now that it's Summer time to get rid of sweat and grime off my scalp and short hair!! Love it has moisturizing aloe and that it suds well without stripping my scalp!! Definitely buy again at my local Target for the Summer months!!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I started using this shampoo a few weeks ago and it has been AMAZING! My hair feels clean and softer than ever. The bottle makes washing my hair way easier. The smell is different (not bad, but wasn't what you normally expect from a shampoo). However, the scent has grown on me. The best I can do to explain it is kinda limey? Overall, this is a great shampoo and I will be switching it to a staple in my constant routine."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"REVIEW EDIT: I wanted to add this important item to my review... If you're out in the sun a lot, this will lightly bleach your hair because of the lemonene in it. My hair has gone from dark brown to a nice honey brown with highlights! I really like how this smells. It has a nice, refreshing lemon smell that gives my senses a wakeup call the mornings that I use it. This delightful hair wash has a more watery feel to it that you use the nozzle to squirt through your scalp, I feel like this way it's really getting to the root of my oil issue. After it's on it lathers well, better than I would imagine with how watery it looks. The only issue I have with this is that I feel like I'm having to wash my hair more when I use this one because my scalp gets oily every other day that I use it, some of the other shampoos I've used last at least 3 days and I can't get this one to do that without using baby powder. The good thing is even though I have to use this more it still lasts a long time, I've been using it for a month and have not run out yet so it's definitely a value for the money. I just don't like having to use it more often than other shampoos on the market."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo has been a lifesaver for my curls. It smells so fresh and clean and makes my hair feel good even though there isn’t much lather!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This stuff is amazing!! Cleans hair thoroughly without drying it out. Smells wonderful...crisp clean scent paired with the gel to cream conditioner your hair is left feeling soft moisturized and detangled. Works great on my hair 3c and my childrens coily hair as well 4c. I love this product line. Wanting to try the rosewater scent as well. Love this stuff!!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,The applicator on this bottle is perfect! I have very thick hair and every time I use this I really feel like ALL my hair and scalp gets cleaned. The scent is nice. It rinses well. But my hair gets a bit oily if I use this every wash. The price point is good! So I do recommend it!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,As you know this product is very good it has olive oil and my honest opinion and makes your skin small soft and feels very clean in your hair I use it every 3 days and it makes my hair feel very healthy I just wish the bottle was a little bigger but it was satisfying to my opinion [product:carol's-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-for-curly-hair]
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,its okay! i feel like its so watery so i end up using more than i want to. it smells so good & leaves my hair feeling clean. i use it when im not planning on doing my whole hair care routine & it still leaves my hair curly
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,1 / 5,"I’ve gone through nearly the entire bottle (washing every few days) so I’ve really given it a chance, IMO. The smell is nice and it feels quite silky to the touch but I absolutely hate how my hair feels when using it. I can’t even run my fingers through it to spread it to the rest of my hair. It does a good job removing oils for the most part and once I use the conditioner it does make my hair feel super silky and soft but I’ve started using other shampoos to really get the job done."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,I use this product in winter or when I've skipped shampooing for a little too long. I normally wait 5 plus days to shampoo my hair. If I feel like I have buildup or a dry scalp this product cures all. I have dry curly hair so I always follow with a deep conditioner. Leaves me feeling clean but not stripped.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,2 / 5,"I was so excited about this product! I love the idea of the liquid consistency and the easy to apply nozzle. I also liked the addition of salicylic acid in the ingredients for exfoliating the scalp skin. However, this product just did not work for me. It does lather well, but as soon as I start to shampoo my hair with this, my hair feels so dry. It makes it so much more difficult to detangle after I wash. I’ve tried to love this product and used it multiple times, but i’d rather use my other clarifying shampoos that leave my hair feeling clean, but not straw-like and dry.￼"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This is my new favorite shampoo, not too many chemicals, #BlackOwned #BlackCompany would definitely recommend to try it!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I liked that this shampoo was clarifying, but when used every wash day, it felt stripping. For those who have oily scalps, this would work well to get rid of any excess oil. The scent can be strong to those with sensitive noses. I would repurchase to use once a week!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,First I want to start by saying I love how you apply this. The nozzle is great to get the product to your scalp. It smells great and leaves my roots and scalp feeling clean but not dry and stripped. Definitely considering to buy again or try another product by this brand.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"I have an oily scalp/roots and dry blonde bleached hair,it is so hard to find the shampoo that would clean my oily roots without over-drying the ends.I saw a dermatologist dr.Dray was using it and decided to try.I bought it at Ulta and I have to say I really like it! It is a very light water to foam consistency,it cleans my scalp really well and does not over-dry my ends. Love the fresh scent as well. Need to try the conditioner too."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,I have never used a water to foam shampoo before so this was a new experience. It didn't lather too well. (Or atleast enough to notice) but I am impressed. My hair is majorly damaged and I think I finally found a shampoo that works for me and my hair:)
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This product is amazing! I love the nozzle on this bottle which is why I wanted to purchase it in the first place. It’s now finally available in Canada (the conditioner too)
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"So happy I found this product! I have 2b waves and a dry scalp from autoimmune issues, and this product is great for me. It lathers beautifully, cuts through oil treatments, and helps with my dry scalp. I’m on bottle 3, I love it!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,1 / 5,"Although this shampoo did a great job cleaning my hair, it also left it dry, feeling stripped and frizzy. FRAGRANCE is the 4th ingredient in this product, which is bad if you have sensitive skin. Usually fragrance is listed at the bottom of the ingredients list on a shampoo bottle, not the very top (indicating alot of it was used in this bottle). Ironically, aloe is mentioned on the front of the bottle, and yet aloe is listed at the very bottom of the ingredients list. The strong odor of the parfum/fragrance was a little too much for me. I did like the applicator on the bottle and you get alot of product for your money. However, this wasn't for me!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,"This is great for stepping out all the residue from my mouse and gel. Lathers up really nice. Tricky to get used to applying since it's really liquid, but it's great for clarifying"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,This is one of my go-tos! It makes wash day so easy because it comes in a bottle with an applicator tip to make sure you don’t miss any areas! The lather is amazing and the smell is really clean. This shampoo doesn’t dry my hair out at all but it leaves my scalp feeling super clean and it also helps define my curls! I LOVE it & will keep buying it for as long as they keep making it lol 😂🙌🏾
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,the smell is amazing and it definitely feels like it’s getting all the dirty out of ur hair without leaving it dry. I love it. I feel like like it may take a while to get foamy sometimes but I honestly love it.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,I started watering down my shampoos and switching my shampoo bottle’s lid with this application nozzle before it was even cool! It allows you to directly apply the shampoo to your scalp without drying out the rest of your hair. I recommend! But you need extra conditioning after using this shampoo in my opinion
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,5 / 5,It is so easy it’s kind of like water when it comes out but it is very soap once you start to use it￼. Elaborate in the hair and it is absolutely amazing
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo For Curly Hair,4 / 5,"I like this shampoo on a day I want a deep clean. It leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean, literally, which for me means that’s it’s probably slightly stripped of moisture now. Otherwise, I love the liquid to foam aspect and the scent is pleasant."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"One of my fav shampoos I always repurchase it for my Weaves and Wigs to Hydrate and bring some life back into them , the smell is amazing and it’s truly nourishing"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I absolutely love this shampoo. I was using a more expensive argan oil product and decided to give this a try to see if the performance was similar. Not only would I say it’s similar, I think it’s better. My hair always feels so clean (not squeaky and overly clean) and soft. It’s less frizzy and has great shine. I will not be going back to the expensive hair products!"

OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,"I didn't like this. It didn't do much for my curly hair. I wasn't expecting it to weigh my hair down and make it appear flat. I have curly hair, and it's bouncy. This only hurt my hair. Value? Not worth it for me"

OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,1 / 5,Terrible product that breaks hair and causes extreme hairfall. The packaging and scent is fine but the product ingredients are harmful and cause breakage

OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Made my hair feel very thick, soft, and smells great. I was able to get a lot for the price. The bottle size and shape makes it easy to pack for travel."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,The product does hydrate and leave your hair feeling soft but it does take a lot more product I feel to achieve the results. The fragrance that is used is not overwhelming it’s very light and overall a nice inexpensive product.

The scent is very nice, not too strong or overwhelming. Packaging is cute, and the product lasts a long time due to the amount of lather, so definitely worth the money."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,Honestly did not love it. It just didn’t work with my hair at all. Made my hair feel gummy and full of products. I feel it did less repair and more just coating the hair to make you believe. The bottle/packaging was nice and sturdy and didn’t break upon dropping it a few times in the shower. It smelt nice but all together I wouldn’t buy again. I’ve had cheaper that felt better
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"All of the ogx shampoos are good, but this one is my favorite. It’s smells good and my hair is so soft and shiny afterwards. I use it with the matching shampoo."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"As someone who’s always on the lookout for the perfect shampoo, I decided to try the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo, and it has truly been a game-changer for my hair care routine. Here’s my detailed experience with this product. The first thing that struck me about the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo was its enticing, luxurious scent. The fragrance is light yet indulgent, making my hair-washing experience feel like a spa day. The shampoo contains argan oil, a revered ingredient known for its moisturizing and repairing properties. Argan oil is rich in vitamin E and antioxidants, which help restore and strengthen hair. The texture of the shampoo is creamy and rich, which feels great when applying it to my hair. A little goes a long way, and it lathers up nicely without being overly foamy. It spreads easily, ensuring that every strand gets coated with the nourishing formula. Despite its richness, it rinses out cleanly, leaving no residue behind. From the very first wash, I noticed a significant difference in the feel of my hair. It was softer, smoother, and more manageable. Over time, the benefits only increased. My hair, which is usually prone to frizz and dryness, became noticeably shinier and healthier. The argan oil really seems to penetrate the hair shaft, providing deep conditioning and improving overall hair health. One of the standout features of this shampoo is its ability to tame frizz. Living in a humid environment, frizz has always been a major concern for me, but the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo has made a considerable difference. My hair is now much easier to style and maintain throughout the day. I also appreciate that OGX products are sulfate-free, which means they are gentler on the hair and scalp. This shampoo does not strip the hair of its natural oils, which is crucial for maintaining hair health. Additionally, the product is paraben-free, which aligns with my preference for more natural and less chemically-laden hair care products. Reading other reviews, I found that many users share my positive experience. People with various hair types, from curly to straight, seem to benefit from this shampoo. The common thread among reviews is the noticeable improvement in hair texture and health. However, as with any product, individual results may vary. Some users with extremely fine hair noted that it can be a bit heavy, so it might be worth considering if you have a similar hair type. Overall, the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo has become a staple in my hair care routine. Its rich, nourishing formula and delightful scent make it a pleasure to use. The improvement in my hair’s texture, shine, and manageability has been remarkable. I would highly recommend this shampoo to anyone looking to enhance their hair’s health and appearance, especially if you struggle with dryness and frizz like I do. As always, it’s a good idea to try a new product and see how it works for your specific hair type and needs. In conclusion, the OGX Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo has exceeded my expectations, and I look forward to continued use for even better results."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,smells sooooooo good. absolutely love the smell. hesitant to use after learning it has ingredients that lead to hair loss. but the strength of the smell aligns with shampoos that are much more expensive. honestly would recommend if ur just looking for a basic good smelling shampoo without hair concerns

OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"This has a lovely scent to it, is effective and decent value for money. However, there are some fairly harmful ingredients in it. The packaging is okay and typical for OGX, nice and easy to open."

It makes my hair so sleek and silky. Its a great shampoo and super affordable. Love this brand and tbh any shampoo from them is great.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,Wasn’t a huge fan of how this made my hair feel and look. It just didnt feel as effective as other hair brands. I also heard that the ingredients aren’t actually good for you either
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,Not bad for a drugstore brand but causes buildup on your scalp and can leave your hair greasy. It has a nice scent and texture but if you read the ingredients you’d change your mind.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"Increíble producto!!!!!! Me encanta!! Llevo años usándolo y la verdad nunca lo dejare de usar, deja mi cabello hermoso y con un brillo hermoso…"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"There’s not really much to dislike about this price. The price point is great and often on offer in various supermarkets and places such as Superdrug and boots. I’ve tried a few in the range but this one’s my favourite - it leaves my hair feeling super soft and silky and it feels really clean. The only downside to this product is some of the ingredients I don’t love and don’t always agree with my hair care routine. All in all though, a really good, affordable product."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"Didn’t do that much to my hair. I have wavy, kind of thick, very long hair. I wash them 1-2 times a week and i felt my scalp did not like this shampoo that much. The packaging looks good but when the bottle gets empty it’s not practical anymore. You almost can’t put it upside down so you kinda leave a lot of product in the bottle."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,Mit diesem Shampoo wasche ich mir seit neustem die Haare und es ist sehr gut ich wasche mir ca 2-3 pro woche die Haare und jedesmal nach dem Waschen fühlen sich die Haare so gut an deshalb ist es ein sehr tolles Produkt und nur weiterzuempfehlen.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I struggle with my ends looking split due to putting heat on my hair and this product smooths them. Smells great, doesn’t leave any residue in my hair. Me and my husband love it."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is effective makes my hair smooth n soft. Has mild scent, smells like oil sometimes. Packaging is bulky and would have been better with pump. Great value for money. Good moisturizing shampoo"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"I wasn't happy with it. My hair was not better after using it with conditioner. Didn't make any difference, wouldn't make it easy to comb, hair was not shiny. I used better products than this."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I've been using the OGX Argan Oil and Morocco Shampoo for several weeks now, and I'm thrilled with the results. This shampoo not only smells amazing but also leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft and manageable. The argan oil in the formula adds a beautiful shine to my hair, and it has helped to reduce frizz significantly. I also appreciate that it's sulfate-free, which is gentle on my color-treated hair. Overall, it's become a staple in my haircare routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality shampoo that nourishes and revitalizes their hair"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"It’s fine. It’s a standard shampoo, doesn’t harm my hair but also doesn’t necessarily seem to help either. Given the option, I’d probably choose something else."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,Tried out a sample size while on vacation and honestly not a good shampoo. It didnt clean my hair as much as I would like since i have very thick hair. The travel size had enough for maybe one hair wash. It did smell pretty good but i wouldn't buy a whole bottle of this shampoo.
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,3 / 5,"It smells great, but the product itself didn’t do much for my hair. OGX shampoos are a mixed bag for me. On the positive side, they come in an array of delightful scents that make shower time enjoyable. They also offer a variety of formulations for different hair types and concerns, which is great for customization. However, I've found that their effectiveness varies. While some OGX shampoos leave my hair feeling clean and manageable, others seem to leave a residue or don't address specific hair issues as well as I'd hoped. It's a bit hit or miss in terms of performance. Overall, OGX shampoos are decent for the price, especially if you find a formula that suits your hair type, but it might take some trial and error to find the perfect match. I'd rate them as a 3 out of 5 for their affordability and fragrance variety, but inconsistency in performance keeps them from a higher rating."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"With these products, my hair does amazing, as long as it's deep conditioning. The bottles arent that big for the price. It always surprises me, the ""healthier"" ""more all natural"" the ingredients are, the more expensive. I had to stop buying this brand bc of the prices and how little the bottles were. And my girls even used the curl shampoo and conditioner"
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! It smells divine and the scent lasts for a long time between washes! It cleans the hair really well without drying it out too much!

OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have curly hair (3b/c) and have used this shampoo with no issues. Not the greatest thing but very satisfactory for my purposes. The smell was alright, kind of a generic nutty rich smell."
OGX Extra Strength Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,5 / 5,"I tried this hair product and didn’t think anything of it, but it’s actually really good! It doesn’t dry the hair out and keeps it hydrated and soft. The only thing I don’t like about it is that the bottle is so small. It won’t last long and in the long run, not as practical."

Worked very well on my husband as he has short hair that would get quite oily and his forehead would end up being shiny and oily later in the day.

Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control 2-in-1,4 / 5,"Arrived quickly and well packaged. I have previously used a fixing powder but not from the Maybeline brand. I loved this! Although the powder is very white (I had concerns about this) it blends in lovely and has a nice matte finish. It's lightweight and doesn't have the ""Talc"" feeling on your face. I have sensitive skin which is prone to flare ups and have had no trouble at all with this finishing powder. I will definitely be buying this again. Highly recommend! This is my own honest, unbiased review and I am not affiliated with the seller or the product in anyway. Hope this review helps, feel free to ask questions! :)"

Redken Color Extend Shampoo,5 / 5,"Great for hair that's been damaged. I used this in conjunction with two other products: the conditioner and Extreme Anti Snap Leave In Treatment. This combination made a huge difference to my hair: split ends, texture, snapping and frizz, all reduced. Tried using them separately and got decent results but more so when using together. If my hair is heat damaged again I will re-purchase. Lathers well and smells lovely. Just be careful not to use too frequently as this helps to get protein back in the hair but there is only so much protein treatment the hair can tolerate, a saturation point, after which hair can become brittle/dry and snap."

Biolage Ultra HydraSource Shampoo for Dry Hair,5 / 5,"The manufacturer positions Biolage Hydra Source Shampoo as a product specifically designed for dry and brittle hair. Its primary goal is to restore and moisturize damaged hair, which is particularly relevant for those struggling with split ends and tangled strands. Nowadays, dryness of hair is very common because we often use blow dryers, curling irons, and straighteners, as well as subject our hair to chemical treatments, particularly during coloring. As a result, hair loses its vitality and natural moisture, becoming not only brittle but also thinner, with ends starting to split—though you likely know all of this already. One aspect of this issue is that it looks unkempt or less than presentable, but the other side is that your hair is simply unhealthy. This is where Biolage Hydra Source Shampoo comes into play, which, according to the manufacturer, does not contain parabens or other harsh ingredients. In theory, this means the shampoo should act gently. My experience using this shampoo was surprisingly positive. First of all, I want to note its light texture, which doesn’t leave any feeling of greasiness or residue on the hair after use. You know how sometimes it feels like you haven’t rinsed out the shampoo properly, and it’s still left in your hair? This shampoo lathers very well, making it easier to apply, and as you might have guessed, it also rinses out easily. After the first use, my hair felt softer and easier to detangle, which is especially important for those with not only dry but also long hair, like mine. Personally, I don’t pay much attention to the scent of shampoos because once you leave the bathroom, no one can usually smell it. But if this is important to you, the scent is pleasant, not overwhelming, and somewhat natural. As for the repair of split ends, I can’t say the results were immediate. No, unfortunately, that’s not the case; I had to wait several weeks of using the shampoo. However, with regular use, I noticed significantly fewer split ends. In conclusion, this shampoo helped me address my problem, though of course, it's not a medical treatment but rather a cosmetic solution."

It was definitely not for his hair type. I bought him a big bottle of the Herbal Essence body, envy volumizing shampoo. He is very happy with this volumizing shampoo it does not weigh down his hair. He was thrilled with the scent of fresh citrus. He did not want a shampoo that smelled like flowers. His hair looks voluminous with body and bounce. Highly recommend this shampoo, especially if you know a man or a teenage boy who wants more volume but doesn't want to smell feminine with certain shampoos that have a floral scent. This shampoo is extremely affordable."

Repair & Protect 7 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I bought this Tresemme shampoo and I decided to test it for a week so I can see some more results than just a one and done. First impression is I liked the smell, it wasn't overpowering and it didn't smell chemical or plastic. I took a shower and used it. Now I'm a cook in a kitchen, my hair gets dirty, greasy and lets face it, smells like a commercial kitchen after a shift. When I finished washing and dried my hair, I did not have any lingering kitchen smells. Plus, it lasted throughout my next day at work and I could still smell the scent- it wasn't overpowering either, just a hint of the smell that lingered and I didn't come home with still commercial kitchen stinky hair. Now, for the after a week of shampooing with this shampoo- I noticed that I didn't have a lot of buildup like I normally do, and I did not have a bunch of hair coming out in clumps (this is a problem I've been dealing with). So, I do believe that this shampoo will be staying in my hair routine for sure."

Not a lot of foam, but enough to get the gunk out."

I’d use it again, for sure."
Not Your Mother's® Way To Grow Long & Strong Shampoo,3 / 5,"*Not my picture* I used this shampoo a long while ago when my hair was short and I was desperate to have it long!

Good enough for the price though!"

Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,This is by far the best shampoo I have bought! It not only smells so good but it does wonders with my hair. When using this I don’t have to wash every day
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"Very good shampoo for me, try it and never forget for u 🐱 never try- never get something good 👍 there is a lot of choice and anything for the hair, try it👍"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,It really does help with volume. A lovely smell as well. Although I have noticed that if you try to keep your hair wrapped up too long it seems to make your scalp feel oilier than usual.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have a rotation of different shampoos that i use, and aussie is always part of it. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel after it dryes. I will never complain of this brand"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I do not typically go for drug store shampoos, but when I have to I like to choose this one because the smell lasts forever and it feels like it actually cleans the hair"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"I hardly use drug store shampoos anymore, but this one is always a go to when I need something. I used this for over 10 years in a rotation of a few other shampoos, and loved it."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,"I didn't like this shampoo. I really loved the smell, but the effect after I rinsed it from my hair was awful. My hair felt *extremely* dry, like it had every ounce of moisture stripped from it, and the texture was like hay, even though my hair was wet. I have oily hair, and this was after I hadn't washed my hair in 3 days, so it was pretty dirty. The only reason I'm rating this 3 stars is because my hair didn't dry with that horrible texture. It was probably only my conditioner (different brand), that saved it. I might use this one more time just to see if I have a different result, but I am very disappointed with this after just one, first time use. I've heard a lot of good things about Aussie, so this was a huge letdown, considering this shampoo is pretty cheap. I will definitely not be purchasing this again."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,1 / 5,I am not a fan of Aussie products in general. But this shampoo in combination with the conditioner ruined my hair. It made my hair extremely dry and made it feel like hay. It also made my hair lose it’s usual shine. 0/10 would not recommend!
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo deep cleans and adds volume without stripping the hair or weighing it down. It has a nice light fragrance and leaves hair soft and manageable.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo, it gives my hair lots of volume, it smells amazing and my hair feels so clean after using it. I would definitely recommend it and the conditioner."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,If I absolutely have to reach for a drugstore product this is on my list. The smell is incredible. Does help with volume and gives a nice lather.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I'm not sure this really gave me anymore volume, but it was a nice shampoo and smells great! A decent price point and easily available at your local store. Recommend!"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I feel like this worked very well for me. I usually only wash my hair once or twice a week and when I first used this product it seemed to have added a lot more bounce to my already naturally curly hair. My hair is straighter towards the roots but curls at the ends, but when I use this product my hair started to curl a little more upward towards my roots."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,I don’t know if I have noticed a different in my hairs volume because it takes a lot to get it there but the smell is absolutely amazing and makes my hair feel soft and healthy!
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,Works well and smells really good. Makes my hair soft after using it and after blow drying my hair. Would recommend.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,2 / 5,I personally don’t love this shampoo or the conditioner. I felt like it would leave a residue on my hair. It also dried my blonde dyed hair out.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,I have very fine hair and this product gives it so much volume. It also leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling great.
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"I remember using Aussie brand in middle school because they smelled so good. This is not my favorite shampoo now, but it is definitely better than some other shampoos."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,Currently using this shampoo along with the matching conditioner. Very nice stuff and it smells good. Went through the shampoo kinda quickly cause it’s a more narrow bottle
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,I like Aussie product for it leaves my hair soft smooth and manageable. It's water based so it's easy for me to wash my 4C hair. Smells great & it's very affordable .
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"Not much to dislike. Keeps my hair fresh until my next wash. Smells good too! My hair is natural straight and not much maintenance so, this works great for me!"
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,I love the Aussie products because of the smell . Now with that being said the volume shampoo I really can’t tell a difference from using it or any other shampoo. I have very fine thin hair so it’s hard to find anything that doesn’t weigh down my hair because it seems like everything weighs down my hair. Other than that I love all their products and like I said it could just be I have unmanageable hair. That’s probably why I keep it up all the time
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,"The smell definitely was a plus, but after using it. I found my hair becoming more dry and coarse. I stopped using it because my hair is fine and thin. I didn’t feel as it was helping my hair."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Smells A-MA-ZING til the next wash, not just after blowdrying...you can literally feel the clean while you're rinsing...it definately gives you a day between washes if need be....24hour+ results...paired with the conditioner of the same name and its HELLO GORGEOUS...."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"I love the smell of this shampoo and my husband does too! It does pretty well with my hair, especially if I use the conditioner that goes along with it."
Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,I love the bounce it gives my hair! I really do feel the difference when i use it. The scent is amazing!
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo truly lives up to its name. The combination of apricot and Australian macadamia oil works wonders on my hair. It leaves it feeling incredibly soft, smooth, and hydrated without weighing it down. The scent is divine—fruity and fresh, but not overpowering. My hair looks shinier and healthier after just a few washes. It also lathers beautifully, so a little goes a long way. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a nourishing shampoo that delivers real results!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Smells amazing, leaves my hair feeling amazingly soft! I have compared to more expensive brands such Raw Sugar shampoo but continue to reach for Aussie products."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I absolutely love this Aussie total miracle 7 in 1 shampoo and conditioner! It makes my hair feel so soft and moisturized. The fragrance is great as well. Definitely for a price friendly opinion.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Smells great and lather up good. It gives my hair great volume and gets all the gunk and products out. It's cost effective and great for my pocket book. My whole family likes it too.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I enjoy using the 7 in 1 miracle shampoo. It leaves my hair so soft and healthy looking. I love the scent of Aussie shampoos. I purchase the bigger bottle and it is still a great price value.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I absolutely love Aussie, if your hair is always frizzy I recommend you trying the 7 in 1 miracle, it helps with the frizz and does not weigh your hair down, and it smells so good and I love the apricot, the ingredients will not harm you, and the price I feel is very fair for the 778 ml I paid 7 dollars!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I am so impressed for a cheap shampoo! I would have never guessed I would find something that worked so well in a family dollar store. I would only purchase salon named shampoos matrix,redken, Amika, etc well I gave this collection a try and I am so glad I did! I even get compliments on how healthy my hair looks now. It’s so shiny and softer! I love the smell of this as well which is another plus. Definitely highly recommended product!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,I think this is a good shampoo for the price point. It left my hair feeling really clean but still soft and not dried out like some shampoos do. It also has a really nice smell.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,The scents is strong at first when applied to hair but after you wash your hair and it dries it definitely leaves such a nice settle smell. The price for 778 ml of shampoo is definitely worth it. This shampoo always tends to last me awhile and well I have long hair. Great for all sorts of hair:)
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"A great shampoo for the price. I do have really oily hair, and it doesn't help much with that, but it still cleans it well. The bottle is huge, with a pump, and smells light and tropical. I like it."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"A nice shampoo for a whole family (except kids). The scent is super pleasant. A small drop is enough to get a decent amount of foam. Cleans well, will buy again"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,WOW what an amazing product. How is it not in your collection? Everything about it is so perfect that you need it every day. We need you in my life now.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is not only one of my favorite smelling shampoos, but you can get it for super cheap, too! It works just as good as the more expensive brands, and it doesn't make my hair feel brittle!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I received coupons in the mail to get some Aussie products for free. I picked the Total Miracle shampoo apricot scent. Plus, I also picked out the conditioner in apricot and the shampoo and conditioner in the avocado scent. When I first used the apricot shampo, I was very impressed with the scent. It had a refreshing apricot and citrus smell to it. The scent engulfed my bathroom leaving it smelling so good. This shampoo is very creamy and feels silky-smooth. When I applied it to my hair it lathered up really well. In fact all you need is a small amount. I add a quarter size drop in my hand and it gets really sudsy. It rinses out very easily and doesn't leave a residue behind. Before I started using this product my hair was falling out really badly. And now my hair has stopped falling out and looks very healthy. It helped hydate my hair and took away the frizz. After I blow dry my hair, my hair feels so soft and my fine/thin hair has volume. My hair also blow drys more quickly since using this brand. After I take a shower and use the apricot scented shampoo and conditioner I feel so energized and rejuvenated. Citrus scents seem to do that to me after using them. I have been buying this ever since I used the shampoo I received with the free coupon. Infused with Apricot and Australian Macadamia oil. Aussie Total Miracle Shampoo is made with ingredients including Australian aloe, jojoba oil, and sea kelp. These ingredients help to support healthy hair growth, soothe the scalp, prevents hair loss, controls dandruff, and strengthens your hair and adds shine to dull hair."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,This Shampoo smells heavenly and makes my hair feel luxuriously smooth! Not to mention that is affordable and available at most superstores. The apricot scent really makes me feel like its summer when I use it!
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo does a lot of different things for your hair. If you’re not sure what your hair needs, this is a good option to pick up that will cover most issues. Not to mention the apricot scent is delicious!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"Not only is the sweet apricot 🍑 smell great in a morning shower, but the shampoo is too! Leaves my hair bouncy and well moisturized. Definitely a new must have 😊"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"This is one of the best shampoos out there, and you can never go wrong for less than $6 a bottle! It really is a miracle! It leaves my hair touchable soft, clean (I shampoo 2-3 times a week), and smells great too. The only reason I don’t give it five stars is because it does tend to pull the color out of my hair (dyed) but otherwise it’s amazing!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Around Christmas and 2021, 2022. I died my hair with peroxide which was a bad decision. I found this shampoo and I used it and it worked great on my hair. It helped with my damaged hair and it made my hair very moisturized and smells amazing.￼"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,"I like this shampoo because it’s cheap and it works okayish, I think to say it’s a miracle is little but exaggerated 😂, if I don’t use conditioner I won’t even be able to detangle my hair , it cleans really well but you MUST use a very deep conditioner after, otherwise your hair would look like a bird’s nest 🪹"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,I buy this all the time! I love it so much. It makes my hair so soft and it smells amazing. I highly recommend this for anyone who has super greasy hair like I do.

Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve tried a lot of different shampoos (even expensive, fancy brands) and none of them have been better on my hair than this one! It leaves my hair feeling refreshed and actually full of volume, plus it smells soooo good!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo is a marvel. It cleans the hair super well and has a very rich scent. My only complaint would be that the fragrance is quite strong but that's a matter of taste. Totally recommended.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,Aussie makes very affordable and readily available products that can be purchased just about anywhere. They have a heavy perfume scent that is pleasing and smells good throughout the day. The ingredients aren’t sulfate or silicon free but it suds well and rinses out easily.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"My regular shampoo wasn't available at the store and i saw this one. I figured I'd give it a shot. Well it's safe to say this is my new favorite. It smells so good and the scent is one of the few that actually stays in my hair after i shower. It makes my hair really soft and tangle free. Which i struggle with usually since my hair goes down to my waist and it's thick. I am really loving this! And it is a really good price. I paid 8 or 9 bucks for it and it's a huge bottle. My other favorite thing about it, is it has a pump so i just put it in it's spot and don't have to mess with it to get my shampoo!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"I started out using miracle curls which I LOVED. Then, I was told to try the total miracle, and my hair loves it. It makes my hair so soft, it looks healthy and hydrated, and I rarely have any knots or tangles when I use the total miracle. I would highly recommend, especially for people with curly/wavy hair!"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Across the board this shampoo checks every box for scent texture and price. Smells great leaves hair soft and shiny and less frizzy. If you buy the 2pack of shampoo and conditioner it is $12 for how big the bottles are that is a steal.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,1 / 5,I love the smell of this shampoo but it just isn't right for my hair. I have dandruff and I was hoping that something different would help but it didn't
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo smells so good!!! Super affordable for such a large size, can't complain! Cleans the hair well while still leaving it soft and manageable, definitely recommend I would say it works well on all hair types."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I like most all AUSSIE products. THIS IS THE TOTAL MIRACLE SHAMPOO IN THE SMELL WITH APRICOT AND AUSTRALIAN MACADAMIA OIL FABULOUS FRAGRANCE LEFT MY HAIR BOUNCY AND FLUFFY BUT NOT TOO MUCH VOLUME PLUS IT COMES IN THIS COOL PUMP BOTTLE FOR EASY DISPENSING WOULD RECOMMEND PLUS IT'S NOT HARD IN THE POCKETS EITHER PRETTY REASONABLY PRICED
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,"This smells so good !!! It makes my hair feel clean also makes it smell so good . It kind of leaves my hair hard to rub my fingers through in the shower . But conditioner makes it more softer !! My hair feels moisturized, shiny and healthy everytime I do use it . My hair doesn’t feel damaged . I’ve been enjoying this !"
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"It smells really good ! I haven't noticed any difference in my hair so not sure what the total miracle claim is ! But it smells good , and it does clean my hair so that's the main reason I bought it."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Good shampoo really good for thick hair and super well priced. Love how much product you get. Great for oily hair or damaged
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,This is a average drugstore type of shampoo. I really wanted to love it and give it a try on my daughters hair. My two girls have Indian type of hair but not super thick. I thought after reading reviews it would be better. I like shampoos that have a added oil that people usually hate because it usually turns out wonderful on their hair. This was baseline basic. I wouldn’t rebuy it either. It does smell good and lathers decent but that’s about it.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,"Does not live up to it’s name. My hair looks and feels smooth, it gives my hair some shine but it’s not long lasting in comparison to my current shampoo. Like one day it works well and the next time it makes my hair greasy or fluffy. It has nice scent, but it also doesn’t last long. I do feel like it shows more of my split ends and where my hair breaks off unevenly. It’s not horrible shampoo and I would say affordable, but I’m not buying it again. And I feel like it gives different results every wash. Depending on how much to use, how long to keep in the hair and wash it off because it might give greasy look."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,I like this shampoo and how good it makes my hair smell and feel. I don't care for the pump because it is hard to get all the shampoo out of the bottle. #haircaresecret
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo lathers easy, and washes my hair well, it keeps my hair feeling smooth and clean. Sometimes If I use it for too long it kind of builds up though and I need to use a different shampoo for a while."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,3 / 5,I just barely bought the Aussie miracle shampoo and conditioner yesterday so today is my first day of using it and the other reason why I gave it three stars is because it did come through with the shyness as well with the oils keeping my hair from looking frizzy but I still got more days to review about the product
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,"Only shampoo we use, helps my hair feel healthier and my husbands curls look better."
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,5 / 5,Love it! My hair is very delicate and entangles easily. This shampoo cleans it smoothly and makes it really soft. Love the scent as well.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,I really liked the product for the time that I used it. I can only use products for so long on my hair before I feel like it stops working.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,4 / 5,Nice shampoo and great for volume and moisture. Always use Aussie and if I ever switch I always end up going back to it.
Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Shampoo,1 / 5,Don’t do it! I thought my daughter had lice she was scratching and flakes of dandruff. I switched shampoos with her now I have. I had used the Avocado one for years no problems. This is garbage. I started reading reviews on here so many saying the same thing. Don’t waste your time or money. I am not sensitive at all never had this happen. [product:aussie-total-miracle-7n1-shampoo-and-conditioner-set-262-oz]

First of THE SMELL! oh my it's absolutely beautiful like a sweet holiday kind of smell and it last on my hair long after its been washed off.

Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Shampoo,4 / 5,A nice shampoo with thick lathering power. I liked the shampoo but not for everyday. The scent was nice. It rinses well. I didn’t see much shine though and combing my hair out was not smooth. I recommend as a basic shampoo.

My biggest issue is, because it's black, it can be a little messy depending on how you store it. We keep our soap on a small rubbery soap holder and the black bits of soap get stuck on it.

African Black Soap Bentonite Clay Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"have had bad acne for the past years. Im in my early 30's now. My acne is cystic acne mainly, and sits on my cheeks, and chin primarily. They are deep, red and take weeks to go away (if they ever do). I have tried switching my laundry soap, multiple face washes, moisturizers, natural oils (like coconut ), my make up and many spot treatments. Some things would make the acne a bit better, but would never actually clear it up. I saw some friends on FB talking about this soap. I found it here on amazon and this was the highest rated black soap I found. I figured, "" what do i have to lose? I've tried everything"". The price was also super reasonable. The bar is very large and I have sliced off chunks to use. So far- I have been using this soap for exactly 1 month. Immediately, I noticed the redness decreased. Over several days, I noticed I had no new pimples developing. After the first two weeks or so the majority of my acne was gone. Now, after one month, a lot of my dark scar spots are gone or seriously diminished. I have only a few remaining red spots. I have made NO other changes to my diet, make up or skin routine. I have only been using the soap 2x a day- morning or evening."

Es schäumt gut auf und reinigt meine Haare gründlich, ohne sie auszutrocknen. Der Conditioner ist ebenfalls sehr gut. Er hat eine cremige Textur und lässt sich leicht in die Haare einarbeiten. Nachdem ich ihn ausgespült habe, fühlen sich meine Haare sofort weich und geschmeidig an. Was mir besonders gut gefällt, ist der Effekt, den diese Produkte auf meine Haare haben. Nach regelmäßiger Anwendung sehen meine Haare gesünder aus und haben mehr Volumen. Sie wirken kräftiger und voller, was ich wirklich toll finde. Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist der Duft der Produkte. Sie riechen angenehm frisch und bleiben auch nach dem Waschen noch eine Weile im Haar erhalten. Alles in allem bin ich mit dem L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo und Conditioner sehr zufrieden.

L'Oréal Paris Fibralogy Shampoo and Conditioner,5 / 5,"This product is fantastic! I have thin hair which is generally just flat and hard to syle. When i do style e.g. curl it ... the curls just drop out within a couple of hours ... no matter how much products and hairspray etc. i apply.

Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"For my girlies with dry, damaged, bleached, over processed hair you need this. The shampoo and conditioner are certainly an investment but an absolute must in your routine to keep your hair healthy and help it recover from harsh services."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love the scent and feel of this shampoo! Super luxurious and my favorite! It does need a double shampoo in my case but the scent is so good, I don’t mind the extra step."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Mon shampooing irremplaçable depuis plus de deux ans , parfait pour les cheveux épais et poreux . Laisse ma chevelure brillante et magnifique , odeur agréable"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"the gold standard of shampoos, pureology’s nanoworks gold shampoo is packed with shea butter, marula oil, and vitamin b1 for ultra dry and dehydrated hair. golden marula oil keeps hair soft and moisturized while a plant based protein keravis gives your hair ultra strength. and it doesn’t stop there, this shampoo also has a beautiful scent that lingers with notes of dewy pear, ylang ylang, and golden amber"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This product actually surprised me at how well it worked. It is a bit on the expensive side, but I have to say it is well worth it. It has an amazing scent and leaves my hair, super soft and shiny, allowing me days in between washing. ￼"

Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"It is my favorite shampoo for the moment. Even though it seems expensive, but it lasts for very long. Hair looks shiny, healthier, easy to comb. I am picky about smells, but this one doesnt bother me."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo is great for color treated and damaged hair. It does not strip my hair of moisture and it smells great too. The bottle it comes in is a great size and value.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I. Love. Purology! I’m a cosmetologist and we used Purology products at the first salon I worked at years ago and that’s how I was introduced to nanoworks. It’s great quality. 🖤 Moisturizing for dry and dull hair. 🖤 Vegan 🖤 Smells Amazing It’s a little expensive but I don’t mind paying extra for something like a really effective conditioner. It’s worth it! I recommend spending the extra money
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"If you hair is dry, damaged and feels hopeless this is for you! It is well worth the $ and smells wonderful! The shampoo & conditioner are both very creamy and repairing. It will repair dry, brittle damaged hair. Also great as an occasional treatment."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have severely dry, frizzy hair that also gets oily at the roots extremely fast so it’s imperative for me to use moisturizing and hydrating hair products! I tried this shampoo because I heard it’s equivalent to the Kerastase nutrise line for very dry hair, as well as the Redken all soft for very dry hair. I really liked the way this shampoo cleansed my oily scalp but left it light weight instead of weighed down. Sometimes shampoos for dry hair will coat the stands with heavy moisturizing ingredients and I prefer volume at the roots. I also always run shampoo down to my hair ends because if I don’t, product like leave in conditioner etc with sit on my hair and will look an absolute oily mess. This formula was gentle enough for me to use everyday, and helped my hair be softer, less frizzy and more “buttery”. I would love to try the conditioner!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is amazing! I love all of the Pureology line, but this is one of my favorites! I have very thick, long type 2c hair that’s frizzy. This product helps smooth my hair and makes it easier to blow dry. ￼It also smells incredible, it’s very thick and lathers well. You use a very small amount and add additional water to your hair because it is so concentrated! I love the liters because I can put a pump on it and measure that way."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,The best from pureology line. Smells amazing and really is so great for over processed hair. Can make my roots a little greasy though so just be mindful but overall such a good value.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,3 / 5,"On one hand, the smell of this shampoo is incredible and cannot be matched. On the other hand, it made my hair incredibly greasy when I used the shampoo and conditioner together. My hair is fine and can get dry, so I usually appreciate a little hydration, but I have to balance this shampoo with a different brand conditioner to avoid looking greasy."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my absolute favorite shampoo! It is nourishing and hydrating and makes my dry, thick, curly hair look amazing. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a long time. It also smells amazing!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Big fan of Pureology. Usually use Strenght cure but tried this one this time. My hair are bleached and curly and I use heat on the regular. The formula is concentrated so you can use only a little and my hair feel healthy, shiny and soft! Might be my new favorite!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Works well, leaves no residue and there isn’t a ton of water so a little goes a long way. Even though it seems expensive, it lasts a really long time."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have very dry bleached blonde hair and it is hard to come across a good hydrating shampoo that wouldn’t weight down my hair. When I tried this product for the first time together with a conditioner from the same brand, I was impressed. My hair feels so soft and look sleek. I will continue using it and see the long term results!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my favorite shampoo on the planet! It dramatically smooths and hydrates my (dry, frizz-prone) hair and gives it such a healthy shine! A+"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have damaged, bleached, and dry hair. This shampoo + the nanoworks gold conditioner have helped my hair so much! It has helped me hydrate my hair without weighing it down. Well worth the price!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Pureology nanoworks is the unicorn of all hair shampoos! It’s great for colored hair and has amazing hair repairing abilities! The smell is phenomenal and stays all day long. The price is steep, but this is one product I’m willing to splurge on!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’m in love 😍 with this Purology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner! Shampooing and conditioning never felt so wonderful! My bleached/ Damaged/parched strands are being treated with absorbing Shea butter, potassium and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. My hair now has vibrancy, shine and volume! ❤️"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"From the first use I was delighted with this product... its effects are immediate, more hydrated hair, more intense color, and shine. When you just put it on, your hair feels a little heavy, but once you finish washing it, your hair changes completely."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I really like this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair sily and smooth , it is very pricey but a little goes a long way . I have highlighted/balyage hair so i use this and always rotate with another brand to switch up ."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"First there’s absolutely NOTHING I disliked about this product!!! NOTHING!!! I loved the smell of it, the way it left my hair feeling absolutely softer, smoother, silkier than ever when my hair was damaged beyond belief from all the bleaching I had done to it. Even after the first use you not only saw a difference but felt it as well. It helped restore what I had stripped away from my hair and helped strengthen and moisturize it back to health."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Quand j’utilisais ce shampoing, c’est quand j’avais des cheveux plus long et plus beaux! En plus de sentir bon, c’est vraiment efficace!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,This is a product well worth the cost. I had lighted my hair for my wedding over several and had a very short cut. Naturally I had breakage. This shampoo helped moisturize and smooth my damaged hair but ensured my new growth was healthy and strong.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"In the past, I had used the strengthening shampoo from this same brand. I did not really see much of a difference at all with it. However, after a couple weeks of using this shampoo, I’m obsessed! My hair has never felt better! I love the scent too! Highly recommend."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I’ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a month now, and I love the smell. It’s a little pricey, but it works really well on my highlighted hair. My hair was really dry before I started using this. It’s helped put moisture back in my hair. I’d definitely recommend this brand."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Is this worth the hype? And the price tag? To me, no. Due to a dermatitis issue I have been using sulfate free shampoos for seven years now. Typically I purchase Hask brand but I received this to try and to me it did not cause any discernible difference in my hair."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I’ve been using the nano works line for a long time and it’s the best shampoo I’ve every used. It’s brought my hair back to life every time I decide to bleach it or change the color and my hair is basically the healthiest it’s every been. :)
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve been using Nanoworks S&C for a few years now. My hair is way more manageable and healthy. I lose less, it breaks less, it doesn’t dry out from getting coloured. It also has great ingredients, I’ll definitely continue to buy this line!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,Do you want healthy amazing hair! Buy this right now !! It’s nourishing and so moisturizing! My hair is super smooth after using this!! Loveee so much!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Expensive but definitely worth the price. Very this consistency which I love for my long, thick hair"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I’ve been using this shampoo for over three weeks now. Before using nanotechnology, I used the Pureology Hydrate line, and to be honest, I plan on sticking with the hydrating line instead of the Nanotechnology for many reasons, one being the nanotechnology shampoo retails for $129 plus tax. The results have not impressed me that all hair feels the same as the hydrating line, and the smell of this nano line is horrible smells like plastic to me sometimes. Highlights and pros ✅100% Vegan ingredients ✅No parabens ✅all hair types ✅non and color treated hair ✅adds Shine ✅Great for dry hair ✅Reduces Frizz Cons ❌No budget friendly ❌smell like plastic ❌Bottle does not come with Pump [product:nanoworks-gold-shampoo]"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I have thick, curly/wavy hair that has been a bit dry recently. I love Pureology, and have used their Hydrate line forever, so I decided to try this out. The shampoo smells great and did leave my hair feeling hydrated, but it didn't lather as much as I like. I tend to overuse product when there is no lather. I love the Nano conditioner, but unsure if I'll keep using the shampoo."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,Nothing compares. Best I've ever used. Hair doesn't get greasy fast. Feels luxurious and smells nice.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Feels absolutely incredible and smells even better! This shampoo is not like regular shampoos, it doesn’t make your hair dry and tangled. This shampoo softens pre conditioner. I really like it! It’s on the pricier side but it’s worth every penny!"
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I’ve been using this shampoo for a while and I can honestly say it has protected my colored hair from fading faster & leaving my hair soft and smelling nice :) I would definitely recommend this shampoo! 10/10!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best smelling shampoo ive ever used! It made my hair feel light n so clean. I really love how light n fluffy it left my hair . Definitely would recommend for people with dyed hair. It kept my color from fading super fast$ I would for sure buy again!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,3 / 5,"So here is the honest truth about  [product:nanoworks-gold-shampoo] which definitely made my hair softer and shinier.  After two weeks of using this my hair is the softest it has been in a long time. However, I only gave this product 3 stars because of the scent which was way too overwhelming for me and not in a good way. Thank you Influentster for sending it to me to try."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,Amazing I can’t say enough good things about this product it made my hair feel absolutely amazing! Definitely worth the High price point
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is simply amazing! Left my hair feeling silky smooth and smells great too! I'm very glad to have recieved this product and to have the opportunity to try it, otherwise I probably never would have had the chance to even know about it let alone use it. I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for a great product at a decent price."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,4 / 5,"I really like how clean my hair feels after a wash, it smells pretty good too. I have dry scalp so Nanoworks Gold Shampoo did help with that unlike most shampoos that leave your hair feeling dry after a wash."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,"Very lightweight, quick to lather, smells amazing, good for color treated, finer, thicker, and older hair."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I loved using this shampoo with the conditioner! Pleasant smell and it lathers really nicely. I have bleached and dyed hair and I noticed when I used this shampoo my hair was more vibrant and not as dry. I would recommend this shampoo line for dry or bleached colored hair!
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I had been looking for a shampoo that would strip my hair of the color this shampoo seems to do the job. I notice very little color lost when washing hair. Makes a good lather.
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,3 / 5,"This was fine. My hair wasn’t colored at the time, which might have helped my review. It left my hair feeling a bit heavy."
Nanoworks Gold Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! It makes my hair silky and smooth and it smells delicious! It has a great lather. I always rinse and repeat and the second wash really does the trick! Pureology is one of my favorite brands and will purchase this in the future!
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,4 / 5,This is such a treat for my hair! I started buying it in bulk after seeing the results and felt in love for how smooth and clean it leaves my hair. I tried the whole line and it does work better with the conditioner.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"I’ve been using this shampoo for years now I like how good it smells and leaves my hair smelling and looking good. I have dry brittle hair. ￼ this shampoo makes my hair, soft, shiny and smooth the same smells like flowers. It smells amazing."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,Been using this shampoo on and off for 30 plus years. I absolutely love the scent of it and love how it makes my hair feel soooo soft and smell sooo good.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,4 / 5,Tried this product as a travel size for my recent trip. It was very moisturizing perfect for my hair that was exposed to lots of sun and ocean water. I would recommend to others.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"I've been using this shampoo for decades on and off. I'm sure this formula is totally not the same I began using all those years ago, but fortunately it seems to have stuck fairly closely to it's good formula that seemed to be developed around 12 or so years ago after it went thru it's big change. Anyway, this on Amazon did seem to be the real product, & I was thankful to find it on sale here. It replenishes the moisture in your hair. I use it to rehab my hair from coloring more often as I get older. It is great. I've seen so many reviews claiming this shampoo, or other great moisturizing shampoos like it, and/or conditioners, are making people's hair fall out. My opinion, not of course knowing these folks in person, but I'd like to venture out with some explanations of what is actually happening. I have very great thick hair. I was blessed with genetics in that regard, thank goodness. Since I began conditioning my hair at age 12, gobs, and I do mean literal gobs of hair come out whenever I wash and condition. I never worried about it because no matter how many hair ""wookies"" left behind (I smear them on my shower wall to prevent them going down the drain, kinda gross I know, but it saves having to fish them out if the drain with a coat hanger later ) but no matter the mass quantities of hair shed left behind, I've never had any thinning or shortage of hair. I've also been cutting my own hair since age 12, but the few times I've visited an actual hair stylist, I have asked them about the gobs of hair that come out when I shower. They've all said the same thing: that it's a normal sign of healthy hair. That's been my experience as well. So I'm just saying, if you use this great moisturizing shampoo, & you lose more hair than usual in the shower etc, please don't panic. It might seriously only be because this product is actually working. Now, I can't explain the poor people who've posted with huge thinning spots on their head etc., but I've even wondered if it might not be corporate sabotage. This is a great product, & it's become a staple in many people's hair routines, so it seems possible that a competing company might pay people to light up the review boards of competing products with wild posts warning about hair loss, preying literally on every girl's worst vanity nightmare. Who knows. The last possibility is that China & other countries slip in some fake product here & there, as I've seen in documentaries. But this seller here seems safe, & I at least have received what I believe to be the real product, & I think I'm on my 3rd bottle now. Who knows. I just wanted to clarify that indeed, as you moisturize your hair, with any good shampoo/conditioner, it smoothes the hair follicle & the hair. Making it easier for the loose strands to wash away. These are just strands that were going to be replaced by new ones anyway. But yes. There might be a period where you lose a lot more hair in the beginning, then as your hair catches up with the new smoothing shampoo etc, it evens out. But it's not a negative. Your hair will reap the benefits of being smoother, shinier, healthier. Also, hair growth literally has seasons. Mine grows longer in the summer but thicker in the winter for some reason. Some articles I've read suggest it depends on where you were born & the climate/seasons in that neck if the woods. Wild stuff. Anyway, just don't panic about the hair in the shower. Because stress absolutely will make your hair fall out. I love this shampoo & beg the hair fairy gods please don't mess with it. Let us keep using it. The scent is lovely, the quality is great, and I've got more of my natural curls back after a season of frying my hair to the point all I had were frizzed out waves. This shampoo helped bring it back to life."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,4 / 5,i tried this shampoo and conditioner after i did my highlights i must say it made my hair very soft like if i never did highlights. very shiny and bouncy and it smells good
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,The best shampoo ever! It leaves my hair so soft and healthy. It is a little pricey but well worth it! You can get it almost anywhere including Safeway!
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,I love the Nexxus shampoo when my hair is feeling dry and unhealthy. As soon as I wash with this it revitalizes my hair and leaves it feeling refreshed and shiny. It smells great and adds a lot of moisture to the scalp and hair.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,This shampoo makes my hair feel so clean without making it feel dry and stripped! Suds up so nicely and cleanses deeply ! Leaves my hair feeling great!
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,Although this shampoo is a bit pricey it is a great value due to the effectiveness in helping my dry hair. Love the scent. The texture of the shampoo helps me control my hair. The bottle packaging is attractive.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"Bought the bigger version after trying it out! Amazing, my hair feels so soft after and I can tell it’s cleaning but moisturizing my scalp at the same time! Smells great and so worth the price . I have curly but fine hair and it works really well."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,I love this Nexxus Humectress Moisture shampoo when paired with the matching conditioner this is designed to help rescue and visibly repair dry hair this locks in moisture for 24 hours smooths hair for long lasting shine repairs dry hair this is salon crafted with caviar and a protein complex for 24 hour moisture this advanced shampoo treats each hair fiber and retains natural movement this treats hair with rehydrating essential nutrients to replenish hair fiber and helps it feel silky smooth my hair is softer shiner and more manageable this leaves hair revitalized without weighing it down giving it flexibility and suppleness and this smells amazing the price is affordable and it is worth the money
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,"When choosing a shampoo, I was referring to the composition. It was great and I made a choice. I tried it for the first time. I wash my hair every day, but the consumption is not great. My hair is shiny, smooth and not frizzy. I think my hair became less brittle. The price was for a volume of 30$, I think it is normal for such quality. Convenient dispenser, thanks to which you can determine the amount of shampoo and reduce consumption."
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,4 / 5,Have been using this shampoo for 17 years and have loved it even when they changed the formula to the ones that say caviar on the front. These always leave my hair clean and silky smooth with no frizz. I have fine hair so I use only a small amount because I will say if you use too much it can give you a flattening effect. I actually rent to buy the huge bottles of this with the pumps because those are the most bang for your bunch they will last almost a year if you wash your hair every other day.
Nexxus Therappe Ultimate Moisture Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair,5 / 5,I came across this brand in a local store and had never tried it before. A quick google revealed it was quite a top end brand and I thought it as worth giving a try. I wasn’t too keen on the fragrance of this product but I did feel that it was good for my hair.

Out on a whim a few months ago, I used Google to try and find a shampoo that would help. I had no idea that an anti-dandriff formula was what I needed.

Dove Dryness & Itch Relief Anti-Dandruff Shampoo,4 / 5,"I suffered from a mix of scalp build up and dandruff. Dove is actually one of the only dandruff shampoos that didn’t leave my hair with a weird texture afterwords. There are softening agents to help with that. However, with also having an oily scalp, I would use this shampoo frequently. This is just a PSA but DO NOT use a dandruff shampoo more than once a week. It will inflame your scalp with all the sulfates and hash chemicals. Overall this product does a good job, I’m giving it one less star (not because of my experience misusing it but) because the fact there are a lot of ingredients known to lead to hair loss and scalp inflammation. Just watch how much and how frequently you use this!"

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,2 / 5,"So I’m a big fan of the pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner but this blonde shampoo totally missed the mark for me. Being that I have blonde highlighted hair I am always looking for the next best blonde shampoo. When this came out I just had to try it, needless to say I wish I hadn’t. This shampoo completely stripped my color and made my pretty gold blonde highlights silvery/grey, which is certainly not what I was going for. I have never had a purple shampoo tone my hair grey to this extent. Normally they just relieve the brass tones and leave my hair pretty blonde. I would not recommend this product unless you have icy blonde /silver colored hair."

Strength Cure Blonde Shampoo,5 / 5,Very good shampoo/conditioner combo. I used it until I ran out. I think it’ll work better if you have color treated hair.

I have experienced there are two different types of the same hair shampoo with Argan oil I have bought, one in Boots and the other is Sainsbury's. One of them is very thick, oily and the colour is cream to yellow. After a wash, my hair was greasy. The second one is silky, creamy, and in a pearly white colour; and this one is really nice. It foams and cleans my scalp gently, and it lives my hair smooth. I also use the Herbal Essence hair mask"

I color my hair all too often, and recently I have made the choice to go purple.

So I did a little research to see what color protection shampoos and conditioners work best for my hair type (over worked, heat styled, fine, and flat.) This was a very popular product as far as reviews go. I can’t see myself using another brand unless of course the scent is amazing. I’m not a big fan of the smell of this product."

Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo for Colored Hair,3 / 5,"I’ll start with the cons on this product. For almost $12 a bottle (for the shampoo, $17 a bottle for conditioner), I only got 6 uses from it. I don’t feel that is reasonably priced. It left my hair dry (even when it was still wet, if that makes any sense to anyone). The two combined did help bring a shine and vibrancy to my very boring brown hair. They both smell really good and lathers well. Overall, I just wouldn’t recommend if you battle dry hair on a daily basis, but if that’s not an issue and you’d prefer color assurance over everything- then this might be the one for you![product:nexxus-color-assure-shampoo-for-colored-hair] and [product:nexxus-color-assure-conditioner-for-colored-hair] ."

Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo,4 / 5,This product smells amazing! Very moisturizing and helps de tangle and keep my hair smooth.

Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo,3 / 5,"I finally got a chance to use this product - I really loved the scent, I’m not sure if I was sent the right product. I read on their website that this specific line “Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter” is very curly and damaged hair. I really like the fact this brand advertising that they use no silicone and parabens but something in the shampoo made me break out, I still finished it. I have fine, uncoloured, wavy hair - so I felt like it didn’t really do much for me. I have purchased their Hibiscus line since receiving this and felt it did the same - nothing."

Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo,1 / 5,"i received this product for free from influenster and maui moisture in exchange for my honest review. i have never had a shampoo leave my hair with such a waxy texture. after using this shampoo, i actually had to re-wash my hair with a different shampoo to try and get rid of the waxy film that was deposited on my hair. the shampoo had a beautiful tropical scent, but i don’t think having waxy hair is worth it just for that."

Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,3 / 5,"I have highlights and lowlights throughout my hair and purchased this to reduce/tone the yellow in my hair after an initial coloring disaster. That said, this is NOT the product to accomplish that. What it DOES do is refresh/brighten my highlights when they become dull. It does NOT nothing for smudged roots and lowlights (hence the Silver in the product name). This product is definitely for those wanting to keep light blonde/bleached hair looking fresh and bright. I highly recommend purchasing a conditioning hair mask as I found this dried my hair to the point it felt and looked brittle. For reference, I have fine hair but a lot of it. However, this product did not weigh down my hair or leave it feeling oily and did not require me to shampoo after using it - it is a true “shampoo”."
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"Das Shampoo ist sehr gut pigmentiert. Es gleich einen leichten bis mittleren Gelbstich sehr gut aus. Es trocknet die Haare nur sehr wenig aus, in Verbindung mit dem passenden Conditioner pflegt es sogar die Haare. Der Duft ist leicht zitrisch und angenehm. Zum Preis- Leistungsverhältnis kann ich nichts sagen, da ich diese Serie geschenkt bekommen habe."

Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,A few years back I let my gray grow out. This shampoo has been a lifesaver in keeping my grays white and not starting to yellow. I use it a couple times a week alternating with my other shampoo. I always get compliments on the color of my gray. Thanks to so silver it stays that way! Lather is nice and price is decent!
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"LOVE this shampoo + the whole So Silver line! Sleek bottles with the prettiest ash purple color, smells amazing, lathers perfectly + it’s not nearly as drying as other purple shampoos! Not nearly as costly either. Tbh when I want that freshly toned/lightened look I let this sit, saturated, on my dry hair for like 3 minutes before lathering + rinsing. I get complimented on my hair every time I go out (not exaggerating!) but I haven’t gone to the salon in over a year- how’s that for proof of quality!?"
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,1 / 5,"My hair is highlighted blonde with a few lowlights and this didn't do anything for my brassiness, but the Matrix Brass Off did. I love Matrix products, but this one is a dud!"
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"It keeps my hair vibrant, smells good, and is easy to use. It's my go-to for maintaining that fresh color.

Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,2 / 5,To be honest this shampoo doesn’t do anything to my hair in terms of keeping the yellow/brassy tones away. I dont notice any difference when using this shampoo. My hair is also drier after i use this. Dont bother.
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"Amazing product, for me once again like some of the other products the cost is a little high for my pocket… left my hair feeling really nice, it was bought from a hairdressers.."

Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"I have tried so many purple shampoos when I started growing out my natural grey and this one is by far the best. At $40 it is definitely not cheap but it's definitely worth the money spent. So many purple shampoos turn my grey purple and this one just brightens it and leaves my hair super soft and silky. Yes it's $40 but this bottle will last me six months+ easily. It's an entire liter of product. Bottle is huge. Smells amazing, like fruity apple, but in a subtle way."
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,1 / 5,This is the most drying shampoo ive ever used. Its horrible and doesnt remove brassiness. Shimmer lights is a million times better than this. Avoid at all cost
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"I decided to mostly bleach (about 90%) my dark brown hair blonde and of course with that came with some brassy tones near my roots. I bought this shampoo and conditioner because it was recommended by my stylist and the results were way better than I was expecting! The really brassy tones that were still near the roots of my hair nearly disappeared within weeks of using it and the blonde throughout was shades cooler (Before picture is the one with glasses). I try to put all the blondes I know on this and even made my mom, who puts lighter blonde highlights in her naturally blonde hair, a loyal user. I can’t recommend this enough!"
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,The 10.1 oz retails for $20 at Ulta which is where I purchased mine from. This has a dull floral scent which isnt my favorite but this product keeps away the brassiness of blonde and keeps my hair healthy and vibrant. This doesn’t stain which is a major key for me when using purple shampoos. There’s tons on the market but some stain scalp/hands/shower. I would repurchase due to the quality of the product.
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"Lo compré sin ninguna expectativa para el mantenimiento de mis baby lights y de verdad que me ha funcionado bastante, matiza muy bien los tonos amarillentos y aporta más luz al cabello."
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,My hair is no longer brassy! I have silver highlights that get yellow and this takes the yellow out like magic! I do suggest using a conditioning mask after as it can dry out your hair.
Matrix So Silver Color Depositing Purple Shampoo for Blonde and Silver Hair,5 / 5,"È uno shampoo neutralizzante anti-giallo specifico per capelli decolorati platino, biondi o grigi. Ha dei pigmenti viola nella sua formulazione che neutralizza il giallo paglia che a volte può apparire dopo la decolorazione.

"Pantene Nutrient Blends Miracle Moisture Boost Rose Water Shampoo for Dry Hair, Sulfate Free",3 / 5,"I think this is an average shampoo for my hair texture (fine, 2b-3a). It had good lather and scent, but I don’t think it was particularly helpful for my hair texture. I think it is a fine product for the price point, but I would not go out of my way to purchase. Moisture shampoos are tricky for me with an oily scalp, so I may be picky. This is an incentivized review."

"Pantene Nutrient Blends Miracle Moisture Boost Rose Water Shampoo for Dry Hair, Sulfate Free",4 / 5,"Gentle cleansing that bubbles up easily and nicely.

Cleaned my hair pretty good but it didn't totally fix my dandruff issue. Didnt make it worse though like some shampoos do. It could be because they use less chemicals than a traditional lime Garnier. Would not purchase though because container is too small, not sure if worth the price. It's like any other regular Pantene shampoo"

But, I did not see any difference in my hair in terms of moisture. I also didn't find it to clean my hair as well as I like, even after shampooing two times. It does lather nicely.

The smell was really nice too, I dislike strong smells from shampoos."
"Pantene Nutrient Blends Miracle Moisture Boost Rose Water Shampoo for Dry Hair, Sulfate Free",4 / 5,"Considering this is sulfate free, it does suds up very well and does give the “squeaky” clean feeling. Scent is pretty non-existent, but also non-offensive. I always wash twice since I do get a lot of product buildup, and this does a good job cleaning it. Although it’s not the greatest for my hair type, I definitely see it working well for others."

Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"Redken Extreme Shampoo has been a game-changer for my hair! 💁‍♀️✨ If you're dealing with dry, damaged, or brittle locks like I was, this shampoo is an absolute must-have in your hair care routine. What makes this shampoo stand out is its potent formula enriched with proteins and ceramides, which work together to strengthen and fortify the hair from within. Every time I lather up, I can feel the nourishing ingredients going to work, leaving my hair feeling stronger and more resilient with each wash. One of my favorite things about this shampoo is its ability to gently cleanse without stripping away essential moisture. Even though it's tough on dirt and impurities, it's still gentle enough for daily use, making it perfect for those of us with dry or damaged hair who need a little extra TLC. After using Redken Extreme Shampoo for some time now, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my hair. It looks and feels smoother, softer, and more manageable, with less breakage and split ends than ever before. Overall, I can't recommend Redken Extreme Shampoo enough to anyone looking to transform their hair from dull and damaged to strong and radiant. Give it a try—you won't be disappointed!"
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"love its texture, reasonable price, always nicely packaged) my hair looks very nice 😻 My hair is very dry and thick so I look for shampoos that keep my hair from frizzing out and hold up a couple days (can't wash it every day). This shampoo is okay but the next day my hair has a lot of fly aways and stand up strays. I'll keep looking for something that works for my type of hair."
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"Es tercera vez que lo compro, he probado otras marcas pero sinceramente este shampoo hace magia, me repara el cabello muy rápido y crece altiro. La primera vez que lo compre llevaba 3 años con el pelo estancado, ahora no para de crecer."
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo has helped my damaged hair so much! It's brought back a soft texture into my hair and the scent is so clean and sweet. Paired with the conditioner it's helped bring my hair back to life, also a little goes a long way and comes in a big bottle. Totally worth the splurge"

I love that it's specifically designed for damaged hair, and that it's infused with antioxidants and plant extracts to help repair and protect. My hair looks and feels healthier than it has in years, and I've even noticed a significant reduction in breakage and split ends. The scent is also amazing - it's like a spa treatment in a bottle! My only minor complaint is that it can be a bit pricey, but trust me, it's worth every penny."
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,My hair dresser recommended this to me years ago and I have repurchased it every time it runs out. This product keeps my hair soft and healthy! 10/10
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’m a die hard redken fan. Every time I try something else I come right back to redken. I just tried the all soft shampoo & conditioner…sweet holy everything…just buy it…you will see why…Ah-mazing! Super rich lather, smoothing conditioner…this is my go to forever now!"
Redken Extreme Shampoo,4 / 5,I love how it would help my damaged hair but I noticed after a couple weeks of using the shampoo it would leave a lot of residue on my hair. Which would make my hair much more oily! But other than that an amazing product definitely worth it if you don’t have an oily scalp.
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,Have tried a range of different brands to keep moisture in my hair without making it oily at the roots as the straightening grows out between treatments and this is the best by far! Tried a sample of this a while ago and finally made the investment a couple of weeks ago and noticed the difference after the first use. Made my hair very soft and much easier to straighten than normal. I also have an issue with my hair getting oily at roots very quickly after washing and found that I was able to leave my hair an extra day without washing with this product.
Redken Extreme Shampoo,4 / 5,Great at stopping breakage! Truly enjoyed quality of product and its value for my money. Recommend to anyone who is experiencing hair breakage!
Redken Extreme Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo is good but I’ve found 2 redk n shampoos to perform better to their claims. It does everything a shampoo should do however I don’t think it does much when it comes to damaged or dry hair.
Redken Extreme Shampoo,3 / 5,"I have brunette, dyed hair and originally went with this formula in an attempt to tone down the brassiness of my hair. It is a good alternative if you don’t want to spend a fortune on hair care products but still have a salon like value to your shampoo. This also did not irritate my scalp, as a lot of shampoos do, and I find the smell to be very pleasant and not too strong. I am only making down because I really didn’t feel like it did wonders for my hair itself, I still had a lot of issues with dryness and breakage but that could just be me personally!"

I do think it’s kind of expensive but you get that with every nice shampoo. It definitely makes my hair softer but I haven’t noticed it doing anything crazy
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"I used to dye my hair at home for years and was super confused as to why I couldn’t get my hair to grow past my shoulders. Then, I went to a hairstylist friend who taught me bout breakage and introduced me to this. I have been using it non stop for years and my hair is almost to my butt now. I can’t speak highly enough about this for anyone wanting healthier hair."

Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,I’m a hairstylist. I’m obsessed with all things Redken and I believe in their products.

Redken Extreme Shampoo,1 / 5,It made my hair breakage so much worse I bought the shampoo conditioner and leave in treatment it was expensive and the reason that matters is because that means I paid money to kill my hair and I thought it was going to repair it
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,"After trying out this shampoo and conditioner, I must say I'm absolutely in love with them! The results have been fantastic, as my hair has become stronger and has a beautiful glossy appearance. I wholeheartedly recommend these products to others. The only thing I wish is that they were a bit more affordable, so I could indulge in using them more frequently. Despite the price, their effectiveness makes them worth having in my hair care routine whenever possible."
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,This is a fantastic shampoo for getting rid of oily hair with build up in need of a wash. I usually go 3-4 days between washes and this stuff cleans my hair so well. It lathers up so well in the shower which makes shampooing a breeze. It also smells clean without crazy fragrance.

Redken Extreme Shampoo,4 / 5,I have curly colored dry hair and I use this product twice a week during my wash days. This product does not strip too much natural oil from my hair.
Redken Extreme Shampoo,5 / 5,This duo of shampoo and conditioner work wonders! The biggest tip I will give you is that to switch out to a different type of shampoo and conditioner. Again to avoid build up on the hair.

OGX Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil Shampoo 13.0 fl oz(pack of 1),5 / 5,"OGX Strength & Length + Keratin Oil Shampoo ist ein wahrer Haar-Superheld, der Ihrem Haar hilft, stark und widerstandsfähig gegen den Stress des Alltags zu werden! Nachdem ich ein paar Wochen mit diesem Shampoo verbracht hatte, konnte ich spüren, wie es die Textur und Textur meiner Haare wirklich zum Besseren veränderte. Dieses Shampoo begrüßt Sie mit einer luxuriösen Perlmuttfarbe und einer dicken, cremigen Textur, die sich leicht verteilen lässt und sofort einen dichten, reichhaltigen Schaum erzeugt. Dies ist definitiv nicht die Art von Shampoo, die ausgewaschen wird, bevor Sie überhaupt Zeit zum Auftragen hatten – es umhüllt das Haar gründlich und gibt dem Keratin und den pflegenden Inhaltsstoffen Zeit, ihre Wirkung zu entfalten. Und das Aroma? Es ist so etwas wie Komfort und Luxus, als würde man mitten in der Seele in ein Spa eintauchen. Das Keratin-Shampoo verspricht zu stärken und vor Haarbruch zu schützen und hält, was es verspricht. Von der ersten Anwendung an wurden meine Haare weniger brüchig und geschmeidiger. Nach einigen Wochen regelmäßiger Anwendung schienen sie weniger anfällig für Beschädigungen zu sein – stärker und widerstandsfähiger gegen Hitzestyling und Kämmen. Die Spitzen wirkten nicht mehr „abgenutzt“ und das Haar sah insgesamt gesünder und gepflegter aus. Besonders gefreut hat mich, dass das Shampoo mit Frizz zurechtkommt: Die Haare sind kämmbarer geworden, fliegen nicht in verschiedene Richtungen und das, ohne sie zu beschweren. Die Formel mit Keratin „versiegelt“ die Haarstruktur im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes, sorgt für Geschmeidigkeit und Glanz und vermittelt das Gefühl, dass das Haar besser vor künftigen Schäden geschützt ist. OGX Strength & Length + Keratin Oil Shampoo kombiniert die Kraft von Keratin mit schützendem Öl, das eine unsichtbare Barriere für das Haar bildet. Keratin ist ein Protein, das natürlicherweise im Haar vorkommt und dort als Aufbaumaterial wirkt, das geschädigte Stellen stärkt und repariert. Das in der Zusammensetzung enthaltene Öl nährt und macht das Haar weich und schafft optimale Bedingungen für das Haarwachstum und die Haarwiederherstellung. • Effektive Stärkung: Das Haar ist weniger brüchig und dichter geworden. • Geeignet für sprödes und geschwächtes Haar, bietet Unterstützung und Schutz in jeder Phase. • Hervorragender Glanz und Geschmeidigkeit ohne schweres Gefühl. • Reduziert Frizz und verleiht dem Haar natürliche Elastizität und Stärke. • Angenehmer Duft und Textur, die das Haarewaschen zum Vergnügen machen. OGX Strength & Length + Keratin Oil Shampoo ist ein Shampoo, das nicht nur reinigt, sondern das Haar gezielt stärkt und schützt, sodass es gesünder und kräftiger wird. Dieses Shampoo war ein echter Glücksfall für mein sprödes Haar, es machte es widerstandsfähiger gegen den Alltagsstress und verlieh ihm einen gesunden, lebendigen Glanz. Ich empfehle es allen, die ein Produkt suchen, das nicht nur reinigt, sondern auch den Zustand ihrer Haare verbessert."

OGX Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil Shampoo 13.0 fl oz(pack of 1),3 / 5,Mediocre shampoo. Made my thin hair even flatter. Other than that it didn’t do much. I could see this working on someone with thicker hair but for thin hair it’s a no go.
OGX Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil Shampoo 13.0 fl oz(pack of 1),1 / 5,"Noooooo! Is the only thing I can say! This formula has too much protein In it (keratin) and will actually break your hair (instead of helping with breakage) Actually, I had thick, long, healthy, thiiiiiiick (did I say that) until I used this product on a regular basis (every other day) for about 3-4 weeks…..then I noticed a head full of flyaways when I went and straightened my hair one night. I was crushed. My hair is my “security blanket” and to have it full of “fly-a-ways and split ends, was just heartbreaking and embarrassing. Anyways, this isn’t a therapy session lol. Just know that keratin is a form of protein and too much protein isn’t good for anybody’s hair"

OGX Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil Shampoo 13.0 fl oz(pack of 1),1 / 5,I used to use this brand pretty exclusively. I liked the scents of the product and it seemed to cleanse my hair nicely. I liked it until I noticed that my hair was drastically thinner compared to the start of me using their products. I stopped immediately and within months my hairs started growing back and filling back in. I worked in the beauty industry at the time and had many friends that used their products and noticed the exact same issue with hair loss. It’s not worth it. Do not use these products. There’s so many better products out on the market in this price range.

Definitely recommend if you’re looking to get more moisture in your hair if you’re also suffering with hair that’s more on the drier side. While it’s definitely more on the pricier side in terms of drugstore hair products, I find that little goes a long way and it lasts me a pretty good amount of time."
OGX Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil Shampoo 13.0 fl oz(pack of 1),4 / 5,"This made my hair smell great and has a long lasting scent.

It is applied easily, the thick consistency does not interfere in any way, on the contrary, it is very economical, because a portion of the conditioner melts on the hair. The scent is strong but I can't figure out what it smells like. Absolutely not like the mass market, when compared with Murumuru Matrix oil, they are from the same category, oriental fragrances. On my hair, the fragrance lasts until the next wash, but I wash my hair every day. When you opebun or a tail, the aroma envelops just the whole, and in the wind it’s generally a buzz I apply this conditioner more often as a mask, because I don’t see the point in just rinsing off this literally precious product for hair.

TRESemmé Split Remedy™ Shampoo,3 / 5,"I've used a several different Tresemme shampoos, conditioners, and styling products over the years. I've noticed the overall experience always feels off and lacking. This shampoo is like that. I didn't notice any improvement in my hair. If anything, it felt worse than when I used other big-name brands. The feel and smell of the product, and the way my hair felt after washing gave me the sense that this is of lower quality. Moisture and softness were minimal, the scents from Tresemme are always weirdly alcoholic / booze-y, and the promise of repaired split ends was not delivered to my hair that got mild split ends. This is an average, okay shampoo. For better results, I suggest choosing a different product from another brand."
TRESemmé Split Remedy™ Shampoo,3 / 5,"Obviously if you have really bad split ends, get a much higher end option or get a hair treatment at a salon. But for the price of this it is okay with helping the split ends in your hair."

John Frieda Go Blonder® Lightening Shampoo,5 / 5,"So- I used to have natural almost platinum blonde hair, up until the last year or two. My hair started to become darker and a lot more brassy however. I’ve tried multiple shampoos that promised to help but I never saw a difference. Or the ones that seemed they’d make a difference felt like they were killing my hair just after one wash. The John Frieda Go Blonder Lightening Shampoo and Conditioner has been AMAZING!!! My hair has started to go lighter again AND it still feels good!! I try not to use it every wash to just be cautious. I rotate with purple shampoo to pull out the brassy color and a hair mask once a week. I am loving my results and will definitely be buying again as soon as I run out!"

I probably will not buy this shampoo again unless it's reformulated to produce a better lather."

It has a light smell of rose. comes out in a gel like consistency. Combined with the conditioner, it left my hair feeling softer after use while still under the showers running water. when it started to dry, there were much less knots but didn't combat frizz or make my hair feel more hydrated. It is plant based and vegan which is a bonus and has an ever so light smell of rose."
Love Beauty And Planet sulfate-free murumuru butter & rose shampoo,4 / 5,"Lo shampoo alla rosa di Love Beauty and the Planet è un'autentica delizia per i capelli. L'aroma avvolgente di rosa dona alla routine di lavaggio un tocco lussuoso e rilassante. La consistenza leggera e la schiuma abbondante rendono l'applicazione facile e i capelli risultano puliti e freschi senza secchezza. Un punto forte è la formulazione vegana e sostenibile, in linea con l'impegno etico del marchio. Tuttavia, va notato che il prezzo potrebbe essere leggermente più alto rispetto ad altri shampoo in commercio. Nonostante ciò, la qualità e l'esperienza complessiva, insieme alla responsabilità ambientale, potrebbero giustificare l'investimento per chi cerca un prodotto di alta qualità e rispettoso dell'ambiente."

It has a nice rose scent which I love and the murumuru butter scent is calming. I have straight, thick, oily hair and I double shampoo. My hair felt smooth and shiny. Since I have an oily scalp, my hair typically becomes greasy after a couple days. I also used the same conditioner. I shed more hair than usual unfortunately."

Ogx Beauty Coconut Curls Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love using this shampoo, literally the best thing for my hair. I have natural curls, not too curly but when using the right products it looks like I styled my hair. With OGX, I don’t need to do anything. I wash my hair, air dry it and the curls are so bouncy and cute, especially on the second and third day.

Ogx Beauty Coconut Curls Shampoo,4 / 5,"When I’d first started my natural hair journey and still applied a bit of heat to my hair this shampoo was amazing! My curls were super soft and lovely. However, that’s because my hair was a bit more heat trained (intentionally loosened my curls) at the time. Now for people with 3c or type 4 curls, this conditioner won’t do much justice for us."
Ogx Beauty Coconut Curls Shampoo,3 / 5,"I really liked the smell and feel of this shampoo, it worked well for my hair for a while but I am finding I need to switch off sometimes and while using this shampoo I switched to a different soap, all natural with natural oils and found it much better.

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,Not Your Mother’s is such a great drugstore brand with so many options to choose from. I have never been disappointed and would recommend this!
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,1 / 5,This brand definitely did not work for me. I have color treated balayaged hair that has also been through Brazilian blowout treatments. I am super careful with products and look for sulfate free ones. This shampoo made my hair dry and left it feeling like hay. I would never purchase this brand again.
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,2 / 5,I wasn’t a big fan of this. It left my hair feeling weird and like it wasn’t properly washed. I have fine hair so that might have been part of the problem

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,This is a great shampoo for natural wavy hair. It leaves the hair feeling moisturized with weighed down. It defines my waves and controls frizz.
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,I love the way this stuff smells it’s amazing but honestly it weighs your hair down so much and made mine so greasy so fast I just didn’t like it.

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,4 / 5,I love this product. I have super long hair and usually go through several bottles of shampoo and conditioner a month. With this I needed very minimal and it did exactly what it said it would
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,4 / 5,"Definitely use this as directed by rubbing in hands before washing hair or you will just wash one section of your hair.

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my go to shampoo and conditioner pair. It can be hard to locate these days in the shampoo and conditioner version instead of just the texture spray or dry shampoo, but it's well worth it when you can find it. It defines your hair in such a way that you have just the right amount of texture. It accentuates the slightest of waves and gives you a natural beachy look."
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,Love the shampoo it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean very gentle great product pretty affordable price I would consider it a mid range shampoo if you can afford to try it you definitely should it’s really not that pricey I did not buy a double set I bought a single this is the only option on there but I absolutely love this brand and it’s sold at Walmart as a higher end products at Walmart definitely worth the money I think it’s priced very well for as good as it works
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"An update to my review, I'm not sure what's going on with their latest batches but the shampoo runs straight out the tube like water. Very disappointed. This was my all-time favorite shampoo and conditioner. It smelled like the beach in a bottle, and it didn't lather up and leave my hair dry and crazy looking. It broke my heart when I couldn't find this in stores anymore. So I had to resort to order and get offline."

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"I bought this and its accompanying conditioner when I found out I was pregnant. I wanted a combination of products with fewer ""weird"" ingredients and had heard good things about NYM. My hair is slightly wavy and, while I noticed a bit more definition than usual, I didn't see enough for a shampoo that claims it gives tousled waves. I like that the product is free of sulfates (perfect for the time I colored my hair in my third trimester)."
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my favorite drugstore shampoo and conditioner duo. I have dry, fine hair, and this left my hair hydrated, but not weighed down.

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"It definitely leaves a clean feeling afterwards, as in it doesn’t leave a residue. It doesn’t weigh your hair down. I have curly medium texture and weight hair. It’s not particularly hydrating enough for me though. I don’t really think I’d buy it again. It just doesn’t do the trick. Not Your Mothers Beach Babe Moisturizing Conditioner"
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"I have naturally wavy hair that I blow out and/or straighten almost every day. I do this because my hair would never dry into defined waves, it would just be a frizzy mess. Before going on a trip to Florida, I decided to try this and see if it would make my slight waves into bigger beachier waves and possibly make them less frizzy. It made my hair wavier for sure, but didn’t do a ton for my frizzy ends. I also felt like it didn’t really cleanse my roots very well. My hair looked dirty by the end of the day whereas with my normal shampoo [product:not-your-mothers-clean-freak-refreshing-shampoo] lets me go two days between washer. This is a great product for those looking to enhance waves, but I don’t recommend if you have oily hair."
Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,Current favorite. Leaves my hair feeling clean and helps give it some body and curl. I almost don’t need to put any frizz control products in after using this stuff.

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"I didn’t love this. The consistency is a little odd, and now that they have their naturals line, I find that that specific curl line is much better. If you don’t have thick or medium thickness curly hair, this might work for you. The scent is coconut and actually quite nice, reminds me of summer, but overall I’d use it if I had to, but I wouldn’t repurchase."

Not Your Mother's® Beach Babe Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"Used this often after beach days when normal shampoo left my hair dry and insanely difficult to comb through.

Comparable in price to OGX products, but in my opinion work much better. Plus I love the scents!"

LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,I love the lush shampoo bars! I’ve used quite a few in the past because they’re really great for traveling! I’ve loved all the scents I’ve tried and they always do what they say they will.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,2 / 5,Handy for travelling but dried my hair out. The smell is lovely but not something I would use every day as my hair would suffer. Environmentally friendly.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I love the New Shampoo Bar. It's the smell that gets me. The spicy smell is amazing! Cinnamon-y! It suds's up nicely and makes my hair feel clean.

Amazing product and really worth the money , as it lasts!"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I stared using this for a sensitive scalp, it doesn’t lather too much and smells very gently. The ingredients contain cinnamon which is naturally very good for invigorating the scalp and it certainly does that. Hair feels fresh and clean once washed. The added bonus is how compact this bar is, just keep it in a soap box for preservation."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"Lush Shampoo Bar is a standout product in hair care, known for its delightful scent—a blend of fresh, natural fragrances that invigorates the senses.

LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,"I use shampoo bars when I want to save space when traveling. This particular shampoo bar really helped with hair growth, as its ingredients stimulated my scalp."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"ALWAYS love lush products but the shampoo bars are the best. They smell great; lather easily and I feel like I am helping the planet! Win win, if you ask me!"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,I alternate hair cleansing products and I use this about every other wash! A little goes a long way and it smells delicious. Love that it has natural ingredients as well and it’s tiny and not liquid so great if you’re traveling !
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I used this shampoo bar for more than 3 months ! The sent was nice, it lasts for so long. I love the fact that it’s made with natural ingredient . I recommande to use their protection case to protect the bar because it sticks and it leaks"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,We used these on a trip abroad and they were so nice instead of worrying about the hassle of liquids. Kept our hair feeling nice and clean and smelling fresh. Would recommend getting a tin to keep it in between traveling.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,I have been a long time user of Lush shampoo bars. I love that they don’t have any extra packaging and they are great to travel with! No needing to get small bottles or worry about the amount in the bottle.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,2 / 5,This stuff dried my hair right out! Good for travel so I would say give it a cry for camping or hiking but it definitely wasn't for my hair. It made my hair feel close to straw.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,I love Lush products so this was not a surprise! I highly recommend this Lush Shampoo bar! It makes my hair look shiny and smells so good as well! Great for travel! I will buy it again!
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,Love love the shampoo bars from lush. Requires a soap rack of some sort in the shower for storage. Lathers well. Leaves hair feeling refreshing and soft.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,I love the LUSH shampoo bars!!! I honestly didn’t think I would like the solid shampoo but I’m a convert!! It’s very effective and smells great!! Thank you LUSH for another fabulous product.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I love these shampoo bars, I am amazed that they suds up so well and leave my hair squeaky clean. The smell is mild and natural. What I like is the fact that each product is stamped by the individual who made it and there is no waste. You do have to purchase a container for the shampoo bar but it is reusable so it is only a one time purchase."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,"This shampoo bar surprised me! I’ve never used a shampoo bar before. This has lasted ages, and I love the fact it saves on single use plastic. It smells divine, just like all lush products. It has a rich berry scent and lathers up well. I may try a different one next time as I do find using it every wash makes my hair dry."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"Mi piace molto questo shampoo solido! È il Primo che ho provato di lush, ha un ottimo profumo speziato e fa molta schiuma, lava bene i capelli, ne basta pochissimo per lavare bene i capelli."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"Questi shampoo sono così profumati e comodi! Li uso molto spesso quando sono in viaggio per la loro compattezza e praticità! In più sono super efficaci, il mio cuoio capelluto è secco e questi shampoo non lo secca ulteriormente, lo rende idratato e pulito per giorni!"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,3 / 5,"It is nice to use and very efficient. I liké the packaging very easy to take along travelling and thé fact that is plasticless shampoo. However every solid Lush shampoo I have tried made my scalp itch, not good for my sensitive skin !"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I love this! It packs with essential oils, herbs, and fresh ingredients, which leave my hair soft and rejuvenated, especially help with hair falling. This tiny bar can last up to 80-100 washes, which is incredible value. They are also have wide of variety to suit different hair types and preferences. Plus, its solid form make it much easier for travel."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,I was using this for quite some time and overall really liked how it cleaned my hair. The only downside was how long it took to lather and when there wasn’t much left how it was more difficult to use.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,I love the shampoo bar for many reasons! Love the no plastic bottle and how clean my hair feels after! Smells great too! I will continue to use and recommend to others.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,"I use the cinnamon shampoo bar which is supposed to stimulate hair growth. Not only do I love cinnamon in general but the scent of this is beautiful! I really like using this and it lathers up enough, but not too much. I find with using this I’d have to wash my hair a little more often than usual but other than that I really like it."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I don’t actually love these products. This was one of the items my boyfriend gifted me for Christmas and, to be honest, I wasn’t super excited about that gift lol. But after actually using it, I’m obsessed. It’s so cool and a little goes a long way and it smells amazing (leaves a scent trail way better than any of my other shampoos). My hair feels cleaner too, like no build up or anything. I highly recommend trying these shampoo bars! It’s also nice because they seem to be better for the environment because of less packaging (but I’m not sure if that’s true)."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"The Lush shampoo bar with Rosemary is a game-changer for anyone looking to boost hair growth and improve overall hair health. I give it a solid 5/5 rating for its amazing performance. Infused with invigorating rosemary oil, this bar stimulates the scalp, promoting circulation and encouraging healthy hair growth. Not only does it effectively cleanse away dirt and oil, but it also leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft and refreshed. What I love most about this shampoo bar is its eco-friendly packaging and long-lasting formula. It's a sustainable alternative to traditional liquid shampoos, reducing plastic waste and environmental impact. Plus, its compact size makes it perfect for travel or on-the-go use. After using this shampoo bar consistently, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall condition of my hair. It looks and feels stronger, shinier, and more voluminous than ever before. I highly recommend the Lush shampoo bar with Rosemary to anyone seeking healthier, happier hair. It's a true gem in the world of hair care."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"The smell is amazing, after using it also the hair smells very good. It had a good foam, it doesn't glue, the hair stays soft and loose. It is vegan and plastic free packaged."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,3 / 5,"It’s pretty good, Not super strong smelling which I like. Lush has simple ingredients which i like. I think i like bottle shampoo more though becuase it makes me feel cleaner and you don’t have to lather it a whole bunch to use it."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"I love Lush, it’s ethically made always packaged amazing the smells are out of this world, and the products always work well wether you have sensitive skin or just want to be careful on the products you use! Always Lush as first choice."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,smells so nice and the ingredients made my skin so soft and the effectiveness is insane made my skin clear and the packaging is so cute and the lather is great!!
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,Jason and the Argon Oil shampoo bar smells beautiful and leaves my hair feeling soft and with plenty of volume. Unlike many other shampoo bars this produces plenty of lather. Like all other Lush products I fully trust the ingredients
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"While companies can’t really claim to be environmentally friendly, I have to give Lush props for creating innovative and sustainable products before it was trendy. Not only do these shampoo bars cut down on plastic waste, but they also perform really well. They lather and clarify like a liquid shampoo, and I can go a few days without washing my hair after. (That’s usually my sign that a shampoo is good.) I have Seanik and Honey, I Washed The Kids; both scents are absolutely delightful. Seanik is a unique, fresh and salty smell that’s reminiscent of their Ocean Salt body scrub. It’s nice, but doesn’t linger in the hair. HIWK is a rich caramel and honey scent that stays with the hair for days. A bonus is that these bars are so easy to travel with, because they don’t count as a liquid. I even like to pack them with my clothes, because they keep everything fresh throughout the trip. I do, however, have trouble with these as they are always getting stuck inside the tin. I think Lush could do a much better job designing a shape that’s easier to work with."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,This product is easy to use and lathers up well to produce a shampoo for your hair. The smell is lovely and fresh. Love the fact it's less packaging for the environment and all products are handmade and vegan/vegetarian. A little goes a long way and a very effective product.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"Io amo questo shampoo. Uso ormai questi shampoo ecosostenibili della Lush da anni. Sono profumati, ti lasciano i capelli morbidi e lucenti. La schiuma è profumata. Li consiglio vivamente anche perché, non si spreca plastica."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,"I love the jasmine scent of Godiva. I've traveled with this to the Caribbean and a cruise and nothing is more awesome than using this at home and the smell brings be back to vacation mode it's goo,ld, compact and perfect for traveling, but using conditioner after this bar is a must as it can leave your hair very dry. Well worth getting the tin too."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,"A different spin on shampoo, and very good for those people who travel. The cinnamon ‘new’ shampoo bar is designed to help improve circulation and increase hair growth. I did not see any evidence of that but it smelt like Christmas 🎄. Not a huge amount of foam, but I know Lish use natural ingredients do I imagine that could be a factor"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,Highly recommend this bar. Eco friendly smells nice and fresh and actually works! The lather in the bar is great also. This bar can last you three times as longer as a bottle of shampoo.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,Lo uso para el pelo graso y tras lavarlo durante una semana se nota mucho más brillante y fuerte. Al principio reseca pero después mucho mejor. Lo recomiendo.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,"El shampoo que usé se llamaba Jason and the argan oil, pero no lo encontré en la selección. Es un producto con un olor fantástico, dura mucho y deja el pelo espectacular. Me encanta 🥰"
LUSH Shampoo Bar,3 / 5,"The Lush shampoo bar was a bit hit-or-miss for me. While it worked decently well for my super short hair, providing a convenient and easy application, it fell short when used on my longer hair. Despite its eco-friendly appeal, the bar didn't quite deliver the clean feeling I expected, leaving my long locks feeling a bit weighed down and less refreshed."
LUSH Shampoo Bar,4 / 5,Has the best fragrance and ladder than any other shampoo bar I have tried. The effectiveness of the shampoo bar is great for any hair type it doesn't come with any packaging which makes it biodegradable and 100% recyclable and the overall value of the product is a 10
LUSH Shampoo Bar,5 / 5,This product lasts soooo long. At first I thought a shampoo bar would be weird but you just rub it in your scalp and hair and it lathers up quite well. The smell is fantastic as well.
LUSH Shampoo Bar,3 / 5,"Nice shampoo bar perfect for traveling, easy to store and gives a clean feeling in the hair. Nice scent and good lather. I really enjoy using this shampoo, especially when traveling"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"Even when I like a product, I tend to always try new things and find that I rarely get the same thing twice. But... I have been using DevaCurl products regularly for 10+ years now and have never found anything that my hair responds to better than this. It's my go - to stuff and even use it on my daughter's curls too. My husband used to seem a bit miffed about the price until he started using on our daughter too and realized how great it is for moisturizing and keeping curly hair feeling great."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,4 / 5,"I wasn’t sure what to expect with this shampoo. I was skeptical when it didn’t lather like I’m used to. But it did a great job and my hair feels clean but not dry! I’ve only used this once, but my initial impression is good, I’ll update after I’ve been using for a month or so!"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,such an amazing product! my hair has been dry & my regular shampoo has not been helping & i decided to try this out and it is perfect! the cleaning without stripping moisture is what a curly girl needs! love it 💝
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,"Used this product for over 3 years, gave me such nice curls until it no longer did during the 3rd or 4th year of using it. My hair was falling out in clumps and I couldn’t even use a brush on my hair because it was too harsh. I do not wish this upon anyone"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,There was a law suite against this brand for people loosing hair in patches after using. I know somebody who got large bold spots after using their shampoo conditioner and this product!
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,2 / 5,Not really a fan of the shampoo because it doesn’t lather well and you end up wanting to use more. Love their other hair styling products though.
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,3 / 5,"I liked this, but I stopped using it for fear of hair loss. I grew uncomfortable using the product after the lawsuits, but I didn’t loose hair myself. I liked the slight pepper mint smell, and tingly clean feeling. The no-lather was strange at first and took some getting used to, to still feel clean without suds. I feel this did a good a job in cleaning my scalp without drying out my hair."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,I think this is a great no poo cleanser. I love the way my hair feels after using it. It is pricey but worth it. You use just a small amount so it lasts a long time.
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,3 / 5,It makes the bottom of my hair curly but it doesn’t do the best at actually cleaning my scalp. ￼
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,2 / 5,I bought this thinking it would make my curls stick together but after using it my hair was heavier than before and fell flat. I find it didn’t really clean my hair at all. The smell is disgusting. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing this product.
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"I usually like a lather when I shampoo but I’ve heard good things about this product, gave it a try, and loved it. Left my hair softer than when I use other shampoos."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,This shampoo is amazing! Not only does it smell fantastic with a lasting scent but it legit works. For years I have tried to make my wavy hair curly and this product does it!
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,"At first I thought I loved this shampoo/conditioner set. But then I started noticing how DRY my hair was getting and that I was losing about 75% more hair!!! I really do not recommend this product to anyone. Thankfully I have thick hair so losing hair really didn’t effect me, I can’t imagine what it would do to someone with thin/very little hair. It could be devastating! After noticing this I googled the products and as it turns out there are many complaints of this happening and a lawsuit.

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,I have used this as my hair cleanser for years. My hair is much less frizzy than it used to be. I feel like it gets my scalp and hair clean but doesn’t strip the natural oils which is the whole point. If you’ve used a “no poo” method then you do have to get used to it. It doesn’t give that squeaky clean feeling that regular shampoo gives but again that’s the whole point. Once you get used to that you’ll find that your hair is smoother and softer. It has a light pleasant smell. I’ve never experienced any problems with this line.
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,Smells great like all Deva products. In combo with the clarifier like needed it works well. No lather like most similar products which is always strange.

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,I've always went for other curly hair products & I bought this on a whim because Amazon had a good price for a kit. And I can't believe how much better my hair feels! My hair still feels just as clean with out the poo!
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,"I wanted this shampoo to work. Unfortunately, it dried my hair’s ends and it left a white cast on my scalp which is build with time. So it’s necessary to used another her shampoo to clean your hair properly."

I'm trying the curly girl method and this was on the list. It's a little expensive but well worth it! I'll definitely be buying this again!
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"This shampoo is so good. It is a non-foaming cleanser. It is not entirely green and clean ingredients, but close. After searching for a perfectly ""clean ingredient"" shampoo, I was not able to find one that worked as well as devacurl in cleansing and how it makes my hair feel - soft, more manageable. I recommend following up with the coordinating conditioner&nbsp;"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,One of the best shampoos if you have curly hair. Using low pop or no pop shampoos for curly hair makes a huge difference.

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,3 / 5,I used this for years but stopped a couple of years ago due to excessive dryness and hair fall. I don’t know if this is what caused it but I switched to a shampoo (one without harsh sulfates) and it seems to work better for my hair.
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,This works great. Believe it or not I have very wavy hair. Lose curls natural no perm but I straighten it cause with all this heat and sweat it becomes this big frizz ball but what I do use is this shampoo to get it squeeky clean before attacking it with the flat iron.
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,At first I thought it was pretty decent but after 5 months my hair became super dried out and brittle. After researching the brand more I noticed a lot of complaints about it. I stopped using it immediately
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,4 / 5,"I used this product for years and it worked very well for me. I feel pretty ambivalent about the scent; it’s not super strong, but it is noticeable. After moving to a location with very hard water, this stopped working for me entirely. Best if you have a shower filter or do not use very hard water; trying to use it with hard water just resulted in itchy scalp and lots of build-up, even when paired with a weekly clarifying shampoo."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"I've used this product now for at least 10 years if not longer. This was the single game changing product i've used on my hair. I have always had curly hair but brushed it and used heavy silicone's thinking that was the only way to deal with them. When I first tried this, my results were almost immediate, I have bouncy curls! My 2c hair jumped to 3a-3b hair and has been happy ever since. People come up to me and ask what I use on my hair. This is my not so secret weapon. It works well, and I use it around 3x a week. Bonus is I adore the scent! I don't know what I would do without this stuff, and I hope I never have to find out."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,4 / 5,"I really loved this when I first started using it, but I never got used to the scent - it smelled like old perfume and was VERY strong. It's basically just a co-wash, which my hair was very happy with. I have dry, wavy, high porosity hair and used this happily for a couple years (curly girl method way only of course) Unfortunately I realized it was causing hairline bumps and scalp irritation and I had to find something else."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,3 / 5,I love love love this cleanser for curly hair. The scent is a heavenly Moroccan mint and rose blend that actually makes me want to get out of bed and into a shower just to enjoy it. The cleanser is smooth and cleans hair and scalp without stripping the hair. This is not

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,"NOT a fan at all. I don’t like the smell, the texture, or how it leaves my hair. For the amount of money paid on this product very disappointing."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,4 / 5,"Great at removing product build up without stripping moisture. I noticed more curl formation before scrunching and diffusing. I have seen so many curly girls that go 3-4 days between hair wash days. I tried, and can make it 3 days in the winter. South Texas is extremely hot and humid, and I CAN NOT go more than two days without washing my hair. I also have backyard chickens and end up with coop bedding and feathers in my hair, on a daily. 😂 I highly recommend for those who have to wash more often. I will continue to purchase. The only reason it didn’t get all five stars was that the scent is rather strong and I prefer a mild scent."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"It took a little getting used to not having a sudsy lather shampoo, but it cleans my hair and scalp way better than drugstore shampoos. I buy the biggest size with the pump and it lasts for a long time!"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,I love Deva shampoo. It makes my hair feel amazing on wash days! Pairing the no poo or low poo with the conditioner your hair will have a great bounce!
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,"I hate devacurl products, they ruined my natural curls and caused a lot of hair loss, and it’s actually happened to a lot of people, I would not recommend them to my worse enemy, trust me steer clear of them, not worth it at all"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"10000000000/10 it’s changed my hair 180. Become healthy shine and make my hair have the perfect curls. It does not have a lot of time when you take a shower, and it's more expensive than another shampoo [brand:devacurl]"
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"Love this line! Any stylist will tell you that people with curls shouldn’t wash often, curly hair dries out and gets frizzy especially if you aren’t using a high end product. The deva curl no poo let’s me “shampoo” without leaving it feeling dry and getting frizzy."
DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,5 / 5,"I received this product for free too test and keep plus review my hair has always been frizzy and dry this product really hydrated my scalp and hair gave my curls flexibility tons of body.

It has an ok fragrance, but the kicker is it’s silicone , paraben, sulfate free it literally has NO bad stuff in it and when ur done washing your hair it’s like a whole new head of hair got placed on your head my hair has NEVER felt this soft in MY ENTIRE LIFE!

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,3 / 5,"I got this shampoo because I was searching online for good products for curly hair and I heard great things about DevaCurl! After using it multiple times I noticed that it didn’t do anything bad to my hair, but it also didn’t reach my expectations. It helped my curls and volume a bit but not as much as I wanted it to. I also heard that it caused hair loss in some people but that didn’t happen to me. In conclusion, it smells great but isn’t the best for improving your hair a lot."

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser - 12 fl oz,1 / 5,"If there is anything in this world I can recommend AVOIDING, it is every single product this company produces. Not only have their products ruined my hair, but they have ruined thousands and then turned to gaslighting their customers instead of seeking solutions or answers. I am disgusted by their blatant disregard for the mental and physical pain they have caused thousands of loyal customers. There are far better products on the market that will not leave you balding with sores on your scalp. And even if they fixed the issues that caused these problems, I would never trust their company again just due to how they have completely mishandled the situation. Do better Devacurl."

Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,I love the Ogx coconut collection - they smell delicious so I feel pampered - I only buy these on 1/2 price sales - I have waist length hair so even when I'm being frugal with the Coconut Miracle ones it's not too pricey. My sensitive skin /scalp doesn't have an allergic reaction either

Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,2 / 5,What I did not like about this product is that it takes so much to wash my wash my hair. I have to add two quarter amounts to cover my hair. I also don't like that it doesn't wash my hair thoroughly when I apply the coconut miracle oil on my hair it leaves my hair feeling very thick and dirty it doesn't feel like it's penetrating my hair and I have to shampoo my hair twice and it just uses a lot of product in order to get the coverage that I need. I also feel like the product doesn't have a lot of scent to it. I just think that this product is not very well made. When you apply the product it doesn't sud you can see in my hand I put product directly on my fingertip and I'm rubbing and it does not make any shampoo so the amount of shampoo that you're going to put in your hand onto your hair will not multiply.
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,4 / 5,"I used to be a huge fan of this brand when I was younger, but there is just better shampoo on the market. I use it to wash my wig because it is affordable and smells nice, but it isn't anything special.

Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,I immediately felt as if I was in a tropical island! It smells so good and my hair was so soft after one use! I was very impressed!!
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,3 / 5,I already went thru the bottles in a week and half! The shampoo does great work on damaged over processed hair BUT IT TAKES WAY TOO MUCH PRODUCT! For my shoulder length thin hair! So I'm sure I can find a better solution that will be much cheaper than 7 bucks a bottle to last such a small amount of time.
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,"I use this line on my girls. They have very thick, curly hair. It really makes their curls pop and come out with minimal manipulation."
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,4 / 5,"While I enjoy the smell and believe this made my hair healthier, after washing my hair with this, my scalp doesn't really feel clean and, I find my hair still looking a little flat and feeling a little greasy immediately after washing and drying it.

Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo leaves my hair very smooth and clean! It has a good smell too. The only thing I don’t like is that it’s a bit small so for people like me that wash their hair multiple times it’s not a good option.
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo! Doesn’t give me dandruff, which is a very big plus. It’s formulated for very dry and damaged hair, which I actually don’t have, but I do think anyone can use this. It gives my hair that hydrated and soft look which I really love!"
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,4 / 5,"OGX's collection of shampoo and conditioner has never been my favorite. In fact, after reading about the use of harmful chemical compounds in their original formula, I threw away the first products I had and stopped using it. That was years ago and recently I received this Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo and Conditioner from Home Tester Club for free in exchange for my honest review. The formula has changed and doesn't seem to have anything in it that I wouldn't use so I tested it and it is MUCH better, but still not my preferred hair cleansing system. I could tell after using it for 2 weeks that my hair is stronger and shinier, which was surprising, however I do not like the way it makes my hair feel. I still feel that I need to follow up with a leave in conditioner because my hair is just not as soft as I would like. I also really dislike the packaging. It is very difficult to squeeze product from the bottles. I gave four stars because my hair is absolutely healthier since using, but I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone with normal hair."
Ogx Beauty Coconut Miracle Oil Shampoo,3 / 5,"I like OGX shampoo and conditioner, it smells great, you don't need much, leaves my hair manageable, silky and shiny. I do recommend this product."

You only need a small amount to get a rich lather, which is great. However, it’s a bit pricey for daily use, so I’d recommend alternating with another shampoo or keeping an eye out for promotions."
Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance(TM) Shampoo Mini 3.3 oz/ 100 mL,5 / 5,"This is definitely not an everyday shampoo for me because I have an oily scalp, but I find myself reaching for this when my hair needs more moisture and strength.

Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance(TM) Shampoo Mini 3.3 oz/ 100 mL,4 / 5,"I really rate olaplex but not as an every day shampoo.

Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance(TM) Shampoo Mini 3.3 oz/ 100 mL,4 / 5,"Since I started using No. 4, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the overall health of my hair. My hair, which tends to be dry and damaged due to chemical treatments, has shown remarkable improvement. Here are some key points from my experience: Texture and Application: The shampoo has a creamy texture and spreads easily. While it doesn’t lather excessively, it cleans the hair effectively without leaving it feeling stripped or dry. Moisture and Softness: After using it, my hair feels softer and more manageable. It not only cleans well but also provides a light level of hydration, preventing my hair from feeling tight or coarse. Repairing Effects: I’ve noticed that my hair is less prone to breakage and split ends. While it’s not a miracle treatment, it definitely helps to keep hair stronger and healthier, complementing other products in the Olaplex line. Fragrance: The scent is subtle and pleasant, not overwhelming. It’s a fresh aroma that doesn’t linger in the hair after washing. Product Performance: A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while. Additionally, it rinses out easily, making the washing process convenient. Olaplex No. 4 is an excellent shampoo for those looking to improve the overall health of their hair. It’s especially effective if you have damaged or chemically treated hair. Although it’s a bit pricier than conventional shampoos, the results justify the investment, particularly if you’re already using other products from the Olaplex line. If you’re looking for a shampoo that not only cleans but also helps repair and strengthen your hair, I would definitely recommend giving No. 4 from Olaplex a try."

Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance(TM) Shampoo Mini 3.3 oz/ 100 mL,5 / 5,"Bin ein grosser Fan von Olaplex Produkten. Sie sind natürlich etwas teuerer als normales Shampoo aus der Drogerie, aber im Vergleich zu anderen Produkten, die von Friseuren genutzt werden, finde ich die Preise von Olaplex total gerechtfertig. Das Shampoo fängt sehr schnell an zu schäumen, wodurch es sehr ergiebig ist und sich super verteilen lässt. Das ist oft ein „Problem“ bei anderen Marken. Somit hat man auch relativ lange was von dem Produkt, da man nicht zu viel auf einmal verwenden muss. Langfristig merkt man, dass die Haare definitiv gesünder sind."

Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance(TM) Shampoo Mini 3.3 oz/ 100 mL,3 / 5,"There was a great promotion going on at our local hair salon supplier store so I purchased both the shampoo and the conditioner from Olaplex in the salon size, which is 2000ml. I had received also samples of Olaplex No. 4 in the regular size in the past. The great news is that both 2000ml products lasted me for over a year. Please note I am not a hair stylist, I purchased both for personal use. Now the bad news is, I was never impressed with these two products. I have colored hair and I just don't feel Olaplex in general ever improved my hair in any way, whatsoever. I never felt my hair was healthier or moisturized with Olaplex, actually quite the opposite. If you are planning to purchase any of these two products in the salon size, apart from suggesting to first try the product in a smaller size and making sure you like it first and not making the mistake I did with buying the salon size bottle, I would suggest asking for an additional pump hence I had issues with the conditioner pump. I am still happy to give Olaplex a second try if the brand will be coming out with new products in the future, but I am not a fan of their perfector, shampoo, and conditioner hence the 3-star rating."

Oribe Gold Lust Repair And Restore Shampoo,2 / 5,"I tried this shampoo system after my beautician recommended it. I wanted to love it, first because it smells so good. But, I believe the fragrance in this product causes my head to break out in psoriasis & acne. I had literal scabs on my scalp. I stopped using it and then tried again, but the moment I did I would break out again. My salon recommended it, but it didn’t work out for my sensitive scalp."
Oribe Gold Lust Repair And Restore Shampoo,2 / 5,"Ok, so I love Oribe but the gold lust shampoo and conditioner are just not for me. I love the hair alchemy (yellow) and have used it for the last year but for some reason the gold lust is terrible on my scalp?

L'Oréal Paris Hair Expertise Color Radiance,4 / 5,"L'ORÉAL PARIS ELVITAL Color Glanz Shampoo & Conditioner Ich habe das L'Oréal Paris Elvital Color Glanz Shampoo und den Conditioner ausprobiert und bin absolut begeistert! Schon der praktische und ansprechende Verpackungsstil fällt sofort auf – es sieht hochwertig aus und lässt sich einfach handhaben. Die Textur des Shampoos ist sehr angenehm: Es ist weder zu dickflüssig noch zu wässrig, wodurch es sich gut verteilen lässt. Das Shampoo schäumt wunderbar auf und schon eine kleine Menge reicht, um das Haar gründlich zu reinigen. Der Duft ist dezent, aber sehr frisch, was ich wirklich mag. Nach der Anwendung fühlt sich mein Haar weich und gepflegt an, ohne dass es beschwert wird. Die Farbe bleibt strahlend und lebendig, wie versprochen! Der Conditioner ergänzt das Shampoo perfekt. Die cremige Textur lässt sich leicht im Haar verteilen und sorgt dafür, dass es direkt nach dem Ausspülen geschmeidig und leicht kämmbar ist. Mein Haar fühlt sich nach der Anwendung gesund und seidig an, und die Leuchtkraft der Farbe wird intensiviert. Was den Preis angeht, finde ich, dass das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis absolut gerechtfertigt ist. Für die Qualität der Produkte und den Schutz meiner Haarfarbe bin ich mehr als zufrieden.

L'Oréal Paris Hair Expertise Color Radiance,4 / 5,"Dignities: Suitable for dry, colored and damaged hair. Retains the brightness of the color of dyed hair. Disadvantages: Lamination is just an advertising move. Every three months, I dye my hair with permanent dyes, and in between colorings, I tinted with various means about once a month. Naturally, there is a question of preserving the hair color so that you have to wear makeup less often. I started using it. The shampoo is thick, good, foams perfectly and smells nice. My dry hair, flooded with a huge amount of styling products, washes perfectly (but I always lather my head 2 times!). And, most importantly, it does not dry your hair! Those who do not have too damaged hair can use it without subsequent application of the balm. That's what I need! that's the color of dyed hair that really lasts longer The packaging is ordinary , I can't say anything bad"

I switch up the conditioner based on my hair’s latest needs and this shampoo continues to be my constant."

Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"The name of this product says it all, it truly gives you perfect hair for the perfect hair day. Prior to using this product, my hair used to get frizzy and poofy throughout the day, but once I started using it, my hair always looks amazing! I can tell the difference when I use a different product. Can’t recommend this shampoo enough for fine hair, it will change your life!!"
Phd Shampoo,3 / 5,This is a nice salon style shampoo so much better for your hair but I personally didn’t notice exceptional results from using. I love living proof stuff but this was just ok
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"So far I love it, used it twice has an great scent makes ur hair smell good all day. 10/10 so expensive though worth it."
Phd Shampoo,4 / 5,An amazing shampoo for someone like me who has dry hair and scalp. Keeps my hair feeling nourished without drying my scalp.
Phd Shampoo,3 / 5,I tried it for 2months i didn’t really liked it! it was pricey and it doesn’t do much to my hair type. my hair is usually oily and greasy even though i was it every day i wanted to find a shampoo that will help me with my hair type i thought this is going to be it but it’s not! all in all it was ok smells amazing though.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo did wonders for my hair. Makes it so soft and strong in the dry heat. The smell is also not overwhelming compared to most other shampoos.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This was recommended for me by my hair stylist and I love it. It works so well on my hair and helps to keep my color treatment fresh!
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,LOVE LOVE LOVE these products! Perfect for any hair type. I use them on my extensions and it works perfect! I recommend this product to all of my clients
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve been using this shampoo for several months now, and think my hair looks absolutely amazing with it. It is very light weight, yet still cleanses very well. Highly recommend"
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"Love this. Feels like I can skip a day or two with no probs. Light scent, great results."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,One of my favorite shampoo of all time. The smell is citrusy and refreshing but not too overwhelming. Last a long time and doesn’t strip away hair color.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This is one of my absolute favorite shampoos. It makes my hair and scalp feel so clean. It gets all the product build up off my hair. My hair is always really soft and shiny after I use it.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo! It clarifies my scalp and works wonders… It even tames my frizz and gives a nice shine to my hair so it doesn’t look dried out
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"My hair LOVES this shampoo as well as the conditioner! I was gifted this and the conditioner from Living Proof, and I’ve never been more surprised by the instant results! It leaves my hair feels so soft, smooth and looking healthy fresh out of the shower. I thought I would like the Living Proof Full shampoo more but this one beats it by a landslide for me!"
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"Phd Shampoo and Conditioner are really a classic now- such a great general use line for most hair! I had forgotten how much I love it and picked it up along with the In Shower Styler and 5 in 1 and I realized there isn’t anything nearly as reliable as this line. If you are looking for a good everyday shampoo, this is it!"
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo it’s amazing. My hair feels great. It is silky and shiny but not greasy. I recommend this shampoo to my friends and family.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This is my first time using this brand. I love the scent of this shampoo. It smells so fresh and so clean. It left my hair feeling soft before I even applied the conditioner. I would absolutely use this again and purchase this when I run out.
Phd Shampoo,4 / 5,Not a fan of the smell of Thai product and doesn’t seem to give much moisture to my hair - anyone else have this issue?
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This is my favorite shampoo!! I have been using this for the past 5 months and I absolutely love it. I was normally washing my hair every day and now I can wait 2-3 days! My hair is not as dry as it used to be. The shampoo also smells amazing.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo is fantastic!! It has a great smell that always leads to people telling you that “your hair smells so good!”. It’s gentle & kind to your hair and takes your hair to new levels health wise! Would recommend it everyone!!
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner brand by FAR. I have seen a huge difference in my hair after my stylist recommended. It smells amazing & my hair has been so shiny and healthy.
Phd Shampoo,3 / 5,"I think that overall this is a pretty good shampoo, that is maybe just priced a bit too high. This shampoo is priced just the same as other big name “luxe” shampoos, but I found that for the same price the results were a little lack lustre, and the larger was less than luxurious. If this works for you and you love it, stick with it! Otherwise I’d try something else first."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this brand and the shampoo & conditioner is no exception! It smells great and doesn’t weigh down my hair. I have long, straight hair that gets oily quickly and this made a difference in how long I could go between washes."
Phd Shampoo,3 / 5,"I was really looking forward to using this product but I felt a little underwhelmed by it, both in cost, scent, and effectiveness. I much prefer other items in the Phd line over this one."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been using PHD Shampoo for about 2 years.&nbsp; It cleans my hair well and makes it very manageable.&nbsp; I will admit,&nbsp; I thought the claims that you could go longer between shampoos was probably not accurate, but it is true.&nbsp; My hair stayed cleaner for a longer period of time.&nbsp; It is a bit pricier than other shampoos, but I think it is well worth it.&nbsp; It lathers well and has a very clean and light fragrance."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,Great product. I was very satisfied with the results. It helped with my dry scalp and I would definitely recommend
Phd Shampoo,1 / 5,I love most Living Proof products but this one I thought was subpar. Perhaps it was just my hair type; fine straight long hair. It just didn’t leave my hair feeling clean and it did feel dry after use. Not a fan.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"Definitely gives a nice deep clean feel . Love the scent and the results after wash. My hair feels light, clean and soft."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This is one of the very few products that make my hair amazing. My hair is so soft and and manageable after using this product.[product:living-proof-healthy-hair-shampoo]
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,My absolutely favorite shampoo and conditioner ever! It keeps me from washing my hair daily. The sent is light and when I wake up my hair still looks awesome! The sent last days! I am 100 percent pleased with this!
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"One of my favorite daily shampoos for a gentle & thorough cleansing, perfect for prepping the hair for styling or just air drying. It is gentle & hydrating enough that I find I usually don’t need to follow up with conditioner; although as a guy with fairly short, oily hair I don’t usually opt for conditioner anyway. This one features Living Proof’s iconic scent, as always."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"Este shampoo es super ligero pero limpia muy bien! No es tan espeso, lo que quiere decir que su nivel de sal es bajo. Como tesioactivo (agente limpiador) tiene el sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate que es un tesioactivo sin sulfato que produce una espuma espesa y cremosa y limpia con suavidad. Su olor es citrico, super agradable y perdura. Definitivamente es un shampoo que puedes utilizar varias veces a la semana. [product:phd-shampoo]"
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo gets the job done and boy does it smell oh so good! It has a decent lather. I don’t think there is anything I would consider changing. It makes my hair feel so clean especially followed up by the conditioner. If you’re questioning it, do it!"
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This product is amazing guys AMAZINGGGGG. It leaves your hair silky smooth. The reviews on sephora website is amazing as well. I would recommend it to everyone.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,I am usually a drug store shampoo kind of girl but with aging and chemically treated hair I had to look for something more. I tried this and I instantly fell in love with it. It has an amazing scent (not over powering) and made to create a lasting effect. I love this and I feel like this really help my hair improved with time
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,Really helps keep the hair clean longer. Also great at fighting frizz and overall giving the hair that “just from the salon” feeling
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best dry shampoo I've found! It's been my saving grace for several years now on those greasy hair days. It's been truly effective at removing/absorbing the grease and adds great volume and scent to my hair. I have blonde hair and I find I still have to work at getting the product in with my fingers and a brush to avoid the wide powdery look. I use it only when I have to though because it sure is expensive!
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,LOVE LOVE LOVE! This product has restored my hair and given it volume it has never had! My hair is so healthy and my hairstylist raves about how healthy it is all the time.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"I'll say the same about this as I did the conditioner, it's extremely healthy food for my hair. The living proof perfect hair day line is pricey for me and unfortunately I have to switch off and on because I can't afford it on a consistent basis. However, this shampoo, the conditioner, as well as other products from this line... They are absolutely amazing! My hair is soft and it holds its style for up to 3 days before it even starts to feel the least bit dirty or weighted down. It definitely gives you a perfect hair day!"
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been searching for a shampoo that could do it all, and I think this might be it. My hair feels clean, but not dry. It seems to be color safe so far. And my hair has never looked better! It doesn't weigh down my hair, but it somehow leaves it feeling healthy and moisturized."
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"Perfect daily shampoo that improves my hair with continued use! Pretty much great for any kind of scalp - mine is generally oily but can be pretty dry in the winter. This shampoo gets all the gunk out without stripping natural oils, and the smell is pleasant but not strong. This is absolute favorite."
Phd Shampoo,4 / 5,I love the PhD dry shampoo and thought I’d give this shampoo a try. It’s a good shampoo and does what it needs to do but isn’t anything amazing.
Phd Shampoo,5 / 5,"Love this shampoo! I have thin, long hair that can be oily at the scalp and dry at the ends and this shampoo meets all my needs!"
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,Loved using this shampoo & conditioner bundle on my hair! Really made my hair shine! Not to mention the scent is lovely! It felt very clean when going on my hair and left me feeling fresh all day!
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"J’ai bien aimé ce shampooing, avec des ingrédients à 96% d’origine naturelles, sans silicones, parabens ou colorants. Très efficace pour un shampooing à volume, et ça sent super bon et frais comme le pamplemousse. Le prix est aussi abordable. Je vais racheter."
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,3 / 5,"smells amazing! and lasts a long time, it is easy to use but i don’t see a difference for volume. my hair is quite long so it may be harder to get a noticeable difference for volume as it is weighed down."
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I think this shampoo smells amazing with a scent that lasts even after the shower. The size of the bottles is great, not huge and bulky, and they are easy to hold to dispense the shampoo. It isn't overly priced. I like that it has less harmful ingredients than most shampoos do."

Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,I definitely don’t recommend this shampoo if you absolutely dislike citrus or grapefruit scented things. The packaging is simple and effective. To be honest i haven’t noticed a difference in the volume of my hair.
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,Loved the way this product not only smelled but cleaned my scalp. I have an oily scalp and usually I feel like the shampoos I use strip my hair and this didn’t 10/10
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"Love it! Smells good and makes my hair feel clean. No feedback about the volumizing, my hair is thick and curly naturally so I don't usually prioritize volume in my products. This is a nice shampoo though and I'm grateful to Influenster and Herbal Essences for the free product!"

It goes perfectly with my Daiquiri Philosophy body wash. My hair also feels really soft and definitely has more volume.

The packaging is also a plus, as it looks nice in my shower (I know this doesn’t matter as much but it is genuinely nice to look at)."

Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love herbal essences products, they always have the best scents. I will warn that the first day if wash the scent is pretty strong and might be overwhelming for some but it dies down by the next day. I think it smells amazing. It seems to do a good wash my hair felt clean after using it."
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,4 / 5,"It had been awhile since I’ve used Herbal Essences, but this has made its way back into my hair care routine! The scent is light and fresh, perfect for summer. I love that it’s not too overbearing, and I get whiffs of it throughout the day. I double cleanse my hair (as I only wash about 2x per week), and this shampoo allows my hair to feel “fresh out of the salon”!"
Grapefruit Silicone Free Volume Shampoo,5 / 5,"This review is for the Herbal Essences Grapefruit Volume shampoo. Like the conditioner, it smells amazing.

I pair it with the conditioner from the same line on my mids and ends. Great product for the price."

My hair is not too dry nor damaged, so I cannot attest to any deep repair-aspect this may bring, but it works as a deep-cleansing shampoo very nicely. Seems to give my hair body. Leaves hair squeaky-clean, has an awesome salon-quality type of scent, and the bottle is super-easy to use, whether it is the large 33-oz pump or the smaller flip-top bottle. Lathers easily, rinses easily. I will say, if you use this, to use a heavy-duty conditioner to follow. It does seem to 'strip' the hair."

Ogx Beauty Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,4 / 5,"My bar might be a little to high for shampoos because I’ve tried many. Many high end. The best I’ve used generally leave my hair feeling very soft after I’ve washed the shampoo away. This did…a little. I’d say out of the drugstore selection, not including any high end brands, this is one of the better options. For this price point, it’s good. If you want to compare it to everything out there then no. It falls short. It’s not as moisturizing as I’d like it to be. It does lather nicely and the smell is pleasant. Many good qualities. Worth a try at least. My hair is dry and damaged from coloring so my needs are more steep."
Ogx Beauty Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo,2 / 5,"For some reason, the shampoo known to everyone did not subdue me. The quality of the hair has not improved at all. Perhaps another line of these shampoos will suit my hair better, but definitely not this one."

Aussie Miraculously Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"I can’t say enough good things about Aussie’s Miraculously Smooth Shampoo with Aloe! From the very first wash, I noticed a dramatic difference in my hair. It left my strands feeling silky, hydrated, and completely frizz-free—something I’ve struggled with for years. The coconut in the formula is a game-changer. It’s so soothing on the scalp and adds just the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down. Plus, the scent is heavenly—fresh, light, and lasts all day! What really amazed me was how manageable my hair became after using it consistently. It detangles effortlessly, styles beautifully, and stays smooth no matter the weather.

The scent even stayed after I got out and my hair dried. You can definitely smell the coconut more in it rather than the mimosa flower but I think the combination helps it to not be a super strong coconut-scented product. I only used it on my scalp and it has a really good lather. I felt it did really good at cleaning my hair and so far it hasn't caused any negative effects. My hair feels soft, clean, and moisturized. *Received as a free product through Topbox Circle*"
Love Beauty And Planet sulfate-free coconut water & mimosa flower shampoo,4 / 5,"🌸Details: The shampoo is formulated to lightly moisturize fine hair while still strengthening & volumizing. It is vegan, silicone, paraben, dye & cruelty-free, made without phthalates. Key ingredients include: organic coconut water & mimosa flowers. Mimosa flowers ethically sourced from Morocco energize & refresh hair. Coconut water provides volume & hydration to fine, thin hair.  🌸 My experience: For reference, I have always had a lot of thick hair, it gets easily weighed down by heavy products, but it has been shedding more often since I hit 30 😅 This also means it has a little less volume than it used to. This shampoo is creamy with an invigorating floral-coconut scent. The shampoo does not lather but cleans my hair well. It also added a decent amount of volume too. I’ve been having really nice hair days! 🌸 Overall: I rate the shampoo 4.5/5 so far for clean, hydrated, smooth, volumized tresses."

L'Oreal Paris Color Radiance More Than Shampoo,3 / 5,"I love that this product is a 2-in-one - it acts as both a shampoo and a mask. It cleanses your hair and scalp as a shampoo would, but it also hydrates your locks - targeting dryness. Having had bleached my hair continuously over the past several months, my hair has taken on a great deal of damage. I had ben trying several products to help improve this, but to no avail.

Dove Advanced Hair Series Oxygen Moisture Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have forever flat hair with no volume to it. This is the only shampoo that isn’t too heavy on my hair, gives it volume and has next to no smell. It is a bit expensive, but it is well worth it in my opinion. A little goes a long way though so make sure to squeeze out an amount the size of a loonie. It lathers up nicely, but my hair is so thick that I have to rinse twice to make sure all of the shampoo is out. Definitely recommend this one though if your hair just needs a bit of volume help."

L'Oreal Paris Triple Resist Reinforcing Shampoo,4 / 5,"The conditioner comes in a black bottle with a pink cap. The bottle is sturdy but needs to be carefully sealed while travelling. So far, I have noticed zero leakage during my travels, so I am pretty happy with that. The fragrance is pleasant and same as Elvive shampoo. After use, it leaves my hair silky smooth.The consistency of the product is perfect, not dense neither runny. It is creamy and spreads easily in the hair and is easy to wash out; however, the product’s claim of reinforcing the hair fibre is false."

SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,Love this product!! Has a slight coconut scent that lasts throughout the week. I find myself having really frizzy hair but this paired with their conditioner does the trick - I have such shiny hair after a wash. The thick product locks in my curly/wavy hair and is definitely on the more affordable side. The packaging comes in a bottle with a convenient pump. A must try fs :)
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,"I received a full sized, 13 fl oz, bottle of Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo with Coconut Milk & Acacia Senegal from TopBox Circle and Shea Moisture in exchange for my honest review. This gentle sulfate free shampoo is ideal for everyday use and suitable for all hair types. The texture/lather is rich, thick and creamy. It completely rinses out leaving no residue. I love the deep cleaning results without stripping and how it makes my extremely dry type 4-ish naturally locked hair feel moisturized. It smells fresh, tropical and almost floral. I thought the scent would be more coconutty. My hair look healthy, less frizzy and shiny. I highly recommend and will purchase this reasonably priced rehydrating hair shampoo in the future. I received this product for free from Topbox Marketing for testing and review purposes. Thanks for including me."
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,3 / 5,Moisture shampoo but yet does not make foam. To have foam need to add more shampoo. Wonderful coconut smell makes it a pleasant experience to use this shampoo. Good for coils dry hair. It does add moisture to hair and keeps it moisturized throughout the next wash. Good shampoo but I wouldn’t purchase again but I do recommend it. Leaves hair soft.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,"We have both shampoo & conditioner in the bulk size because it’s a great everyday shampoo & conditioner. The scent is a light coconut, which I love, nothing overpowering. It keeps the waves soft & moisturized in the down south heat. The container has a push nozzle which makes it easy to get out and does not deposit too much product. I don’t notice any huge changes in curl pattern, but then again I don’t pay much attention to it. Overall, great everyday product."
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,"Great coconut scent, the lather is not too overwhelming and it rinses off with minimal effort while still leaving my hair moisturized and silky. I wish the packaging had a better grip so it won’t slip while trying to use it."
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,"I use alot of Shea Moisture products so I'm already familiar with the brand. I received this product from TopBox along with the conditioner for free. The smell is a tropical paradise , puts you in the mind of a Pina Colada. I enjoy the light smell that lingers in my hair afterwards, its light not overpowering at all. I usually shampoo 2-3 times during wash day, this had my hair feeling cleaned and not stripped after 2 rinses. It doesnt give that squeaky clean feeling that I get from my staple shampoo but I can definitely see me adding this as an in between. This is a gentle wash shampoo that left my hair feeling hydrated!"
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,3 / 5,"I've been using Shea Moisture's Coconut Daily Shampoo for a while now, and I have to say, it's become a staple in my hair care routine.

I have wavy, slightly curly hair, and this shampoo left it feeling so clean and weightless. My normal frizz was drastically reduced. It looked healthy and natural.

SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,The scent on this is beautiful the ingredients are fairly clean. The only thing I don't like is the watery texture I wish it was a little bit thicker. I wish the packages was a pump for the shampoo.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,I was so excited to try this shampoo. The coconut smell is amazing; even after my hair dries the smell is pretty strong!

SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,I had received this product in exchange for an honest review and I loved it. Not only because shea moisturize is a curly hair brand but also because it left my curls looking more fresh and defined. The packaging could be less difficult to squeeze out the product. Shea moisture is definitely one of the affordable brand of curly hair products!

SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,I liked the shampoo more than the conditioner. I like how it doesn’t have additives to it which means it doesn’t lather as well but that’s okay. I however didn’t notice how much superior this is to other shampoos I’ve tried. I wouldn’t necessarily repurchase unless it was for a steep discount.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,The scent of the shampoo is AMAZING!! The ingredients are pretty clean and i love that it is color safe. The price is cheaper if you can buy it from costco on sale. I hate that sometimes it leaves my hair little bit greasy. Other than that i love it.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,3 / 5,"I wanted to love this product but it just wasn’t quite there. It’s nearly impossible to squeeze this product out of the bottle. I had to ask one of my brothers to squeeze product into my hands whenever I wanted to use it. It’s hard to describe the consistency- it’s almost gelatin-like but also watery if that makes sense. It feels good when applying but the moisture I felt didn’t last as long as I would have liked. It’s not an oily product so if you’re looking for something on the lighter side, this would be a good option. One thing I do love about this moisturizer is the scent! It has a light coconut smell that’s not overpowering. I also originally bought this moisturizer because it’s free of any harsh chemicals and made with natural ingredients."

The coconut smell is also amazing and long lasting. Would definitely recommend for curly heads!!"
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,Hands down one of the best shampoos I’ve ever used. My hair feels so moisturized even in the shower. Most shampoos my hair feels dry right after rinsing it out before applying conditioner but with this one my hair feels so soft.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have very fine curly hair and this shampoo does an amazing job at moisturizing and making my hair look shiny!!

It does foam up amazingly on my hair so I use a little bit more amount than I would like to.It does cleanse the hair and the scalp really well. Smells lovely. It is a subtle smell that makes me feel clean and refreshed. It is a great summer product in my opinion. I definitely need to use moisturiser afterwards as my hair gets very knotty. This products cleanses the hair really well.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,"While I don’t think it’s perfect, I’ve tried many shampoos and this one has been my favorite for a few years now. It makes my hair feel so clean and soft."

Since trying this shampoo I’ve continued to purchase more of their products including leave in conditioners and body wash. All of which perform as expected."
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo brings back life to your hair. 4/5 stars just because it could be too much moisture for finer hair. This shampoo doesn’t lather on the first go but the second shampoo lathers beautifully!
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo. I have really curly hair and while I typically use shampoo and conditioner targeted towards that, I also like to supplement with this sometimes. It smells great, my hair is clean and soft. I really love to use it after swimming at the beach or in the pool."
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,"My hair wasn't really damaged when I started using this shampoo, but it did make my hair feel thicker and stronger. The first time I actually noticed a difference was on the 3rd day of using this shampoo. My hair felt healthier, shinier and stronger. I even noticed that after a few days, I wasn't having to brush it out as much as I normally do. And it smells amazing, too!"
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,Love that this shampoo has hydrated my dry hair. I don’t even need conditioner! I definitely recommend this to others. No harmful silicones nor any harmful sulfate.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,I have dry scalp and this shampoo dies the perfect job of keep it hydrated. Once a week is enough to keep the moisture in and avoid dryness. Definitely recommend for dry hair!
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,2 / 5,"This is my least favorite shampoo for a couple of reasons, but keep in mind just because it doesn’t work for me and may be fantastic for somebody else. It has been recommended to me a ton of times since I’ve been on the hair care journey to repair and strengthen my locks.￼ It is extremely thick and luxurious with a non-overpowering scent. I find you need to use just a little as it turns to stick to my hair, and simply does not wash out easily. Even with just a one pump or one squirt situation, roughly the size of a quarter, I am left with heavy buildup and it doesn’t wash clean. Even after washing for a long time to ensure all product is rinsed out, I find my hair looks greasy just a few hours afterwards. It also feels as if there is product left in the hair. Tremendous amount of buildup almost right away. I do love the conditioner and use that consistently, but the shampoo just does not work for me."
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo makes my hair feels super light, I don’t get the same heavy feeling when I use this shampoo (it happens with some other brands). I just feel like it doesn’t help my curls as much, otherwise would totally be 5 stars"
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,5 / 5,For all the curly or dry hair people try this! I live in Minnesota it’s dry and cold my hair is always dry but when I started using this my hair was softer and stayed hydrated even at the dead of the winter! It doesn’t strip the hair either!! Try it!!
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,3 / 5,I gave this shampoo a 3 stars because it seemed to take a bit to wash out. It left my hair extremely soft in comparison to similar brands of shampoos. I also enjoyed the scent of the shampoo. I like the packaging of this shampoo label. The price is also quite fair. I would recommend trying this brand of shampoo as there are multiple types.
SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo,3 / 5,"This shampoo is good for who have hair not damaged, it smell very coconuty and trpoical. But for me, this is not for sombody who trying to look a shampoo for dry scalp, this is good for who want a realy nice smell on hair."

Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,5 / 5,"I loved this shampoo and it's conditioner counterpart! Like many people have stated it is affordable but doesn't leave my scalp dry and does a good job of cleaning! Unfortunately I can't find it anywhere and I think eva nyc has discontinued this product, which I am very sad about. Does anyone have similar recommendations for someone with an oily scalp but thick hair?"
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,4 / 5,"This is a really good shampoo (Eva NYC is discontinuing it so now is the time to buy it up at a discount!), an overall general moisturizing/balancing formula with argan oil. I prefer the [product:eva-nyc-mane-magic-10-in-1-shampoo] as it REALLY multitasks for all needs, but this one is good for the price if you don’t have extreme needs."
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,5 / 5,always makes my hair feel so clean as well as moisturized so don’t dry out my scalp. smells amazing too!!!
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,2 / 5,The color is supposed to get more prevalent as you use it and only wash out when you use regular shampoo. I used it for a month with very little change to my hair. It did make my scalp pink but thats about it
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,5 / 5,Excellent shampoo. Leaves your scalp feeling clean but doesnt overdry your hair. My hair is curly but I have keratin on so it gets greasy on the scalp fast and dry from the middle to the tips when it doesnt have the right treatment but this shampoo (plus conditioner) makes it feel light and bouncy and shiny which I love.
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,4 / 5,"Very good shampoo for 4emoving build up and it smells great! Left my hair soft, clean and shiny! I use it once a month. The only drawback is that it's very thin! You have to be careful when pouring it out because it's very easy to get too much!"

Leaves hair clean & really soft, smells absolutely wonderful, and doesn't overdry if your a daily washer. 💦 [product:eva-nyc-clean-it-up-shampoo]"

Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo and this brand In general. All their products smell so good and the ingredients are incredible. They leave my hair smooth shiny easy to brush and incredibly great smelling!!
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,4 / 5,"I use this when I need to give my hair a deep clean from using dry shampoos and waxes, and it works wonders my hair feels clean for almost 3 days straight! The only downside is that it’s not great for color treated/bleached hair because it’s very drying on the ends, leaving my hair straw like at times. So I’ll only use it on my scalp and then deep condition my ends. It smells really nice the bottle is so cute."
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,5 / 5,Tiene un Aroma riquísimo me encanta y me deja el cabello suavecito y un aroma riquísimo me encanta...

Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,4 / 5,"What a surprise this shampoo was!!! I have incredibly oily hair that's very long (thanks pandemic.). I found this on sale and decided to give it a try. It's the perfect size, it's huge! And the shampoo is great! It snacks cleans my oily scalp and hair and leaves us smelling fresh, but very light scent! This is a great shampoo to have around, I highly recommend it!"
Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo,3 / 5,I love the smell of this product! It’s a scent that lingers after washing but that isn’t over powering either. The only problem is this shampoo doesn’t agree with my hair very well and because of that I can’t use it on a regular basis.

But the scents is rrally good the liquid forn in it is also not thick, i actually love but it doesn’t fit to my hairtype.."

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,I was curious how my hair would look and feel after using this shampoo. I love how soft and clean my hair is. It smells amazing and my hair looks awesome.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"The shampoo layers decently, though I would prefer a little more, but it is the smell that I particularly don’t enjoy which is why I wouldn’t buy this product. I want my hair to smell beautiful after a wash and this smell just isn’t for me. It smells too chemical."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,This was just too dry for my bleached hair. If you need tons of moisture this just isn’t it. It smells nice and has nice packaging but not for super dry hair to use on a regular basis.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,4 / 5,It smells amazing and has a good amount of lathering. This is a brand I grew up using. It made my hair shiny and bouncy and is pivotal in my beauty care regimen. Two thumbs up.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,4 / 5,My thoughts about this product are pretty much the same as the conditioner. I reallllllyyy enjoy the consistency of this product. It’s very foaming right out of the bottle and it spreads in the hair very nicely which is something I look for in shampoos. I haven’t seen any changes in my hair but I do enjoy the product. I would repurchase and would definitely try a mask from this product if they have one.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,I love the smell of it. I was disappointed how it did not lather up much. It’s was a little thinner quality then I would have hoped for.

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,I’m not one to buy fancy shampoo and conditioner. But I love the way this smells. Reminds me of my stepmom from when I was younger.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"After bleaching my hair I can tell when a shampoo is too harsh, and this one definitely isn't. My hair still feels pretty soft after the first lather and it doesn't leave a super strong scent either. I used it with the conditioner and my hair felt moisturized and silky. I recommend!"
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"Finesse shampoo and conditioner: smells okay, makes my hair soft, doesn’t feel too heavy. **I received these products for free from Influenster and applicable brands (Flipz, Finesse, Chapstick) in exchange for my honest review."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"I got this as part of my step into spring box and I didn't have to review it, but I have to, it's so good. This stuff is great. I have hair on the oily side and wash it every time I run. This smells nice and lathers well and seems to keep my scalp clean, which is a major requirement for shampoo. But I was not ready for how SHINY my hair would be. My hair is thicker, more full, more lovely than I expected."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,Este champú utilizado regularmente junto con el acondicionador me tienen encantada. De verdad fue un excelente regalo de Influenster porque me ha funcionado muy bien.

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,The shampoo makes your hair feel soft manageable and kinda feels a little bit stronger I did try for a few days and the hair seems a little bit different so I think it It might be making some kind of a progress it might be restoring and strengthening the hair. The scent of Camellia oil its pleasant kind of soothing soothing and feels nice I like it. #complimentary #finesseyourhair #stepintospring #chapstickgreenapple @Influenster @flipz @finessehaircare @chapstick
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"The smell is not super overwhelming in fact it’s very faint. I feel like I have to wash 2 times to really get my hair clean, it doesn’t lather in my hair well. I have medium hair in length and thickness."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,1 / 5,This shampoo has an incredibly strong scent that reminds me of detergent. It stripped my wavy hair of any moisuture and left it looking stringy.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"I like this shampoo, the smell isn’t too overwhelming. I washed my hair with both the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo didn’t get as sudsy as other brands I’ve used but I was also in a rush. My hair smells nice and feels soft on top, the rest of it is still drying. My natural curls look nice, my hair is slightly frizzy."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"This smells pretty good to me. Even though it’s a shampoo, it’s actually moisturizing as well so it doesn’t dry my hair out like other shampoos. Super gentle on the hair"

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,I washed my hair 3 times so far. Really helped in strengthening hair roots. Hair shedding stopped completely. It is good product.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,1 / 5,"I really wanted to like this product and tried for several days before deciding how bad it is. First, the smell of this shampoo brought me back to my days in my childhood when I used a product to kill lice I got from school. It was very chemically and not a pleasant smell. The product itself lathered well and felt fine after washing but when it dried it was horrible. It made my hair break off at spots, was frizzy beyond belief. This is probably one of the worst shampoos/conditioners I've ever used."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,I got these complimentary from Influnester as part of the Spring CoOp box in exchange for my honest review. I was able to try them the other night and its definitely not something I'll be using. I'll use on my kids as their hair is natural. It dried my hair out really bad and ended up having to use a hair mask to repair my hair. Smells weird too! Thank you for the opportunity to try these tho!
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,I received these products for free from Influenster and Finesse in exchange for my honest review. This shampoo feels so thick and luxurious when you lather with it! It feels extremely hydrating and it’s smell is absolutely delicious. The conditioner was thinner in texture and is easily rinsed. This combo doesn’t strip my curly/frizzy/oily prone hair the way other shampoos can and also doesn’t leave it with that greasy residue that a lot of hydrating conditioning formulas can. My hair smells and feels great after washing and conditioning. I was actually quite surprised that this formula could hydrate without leaving that greasy feeling! I am most definitely a fan and will continue to use them. I would recommend to anyone whose hair texture needs hydration but is also prone to oiliness!
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,1 / 5,"I was sent the finesse restore and strengthen moisturizing shampoo from Influenster and finesse. I’ll give this product a hard one star because it has very toxic chemicals that damage your hair such as sulfates, parabens, etc. if you don’t care about what your shampoo does to your hair then I’d recommend it to a friend"

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have never heard of this brand before so I was excited to give it a try. The scent is strong, you could smell it through the box and at first I thought it was perfume but was surprised with these full sized shampoo and conditioner bottles. They both smell amazing. They both leave a wonderful scent in your hair, it leave's you feeling fresh, your hair looking healthier, it also makes your hair soft and silky. I can't believe I never heard of this brand before but I'm so glad I got the opportunity to have tested it out. I'm definitely going to have to go buy a few bottles of both because my oldest daughter took mine after trying it out and loving the results it leaves. She dyes her hair a lot, so her hair is really dry and she said after using both shampoo and conditioner that her hair didn't look or feel dried out any more."

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"Received this in one of my campaigns. I was excited to try it. First I was impressed at how well it lathered, I didn’t feel like I had to use as much product. But it definitely had an interesting smell, like pepper?? It made my hair kind of feel like I had a film on it before it dried. After drying my hair seemed to be frizzier and not as soft. Overall I would not purchase this product in the future."
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,Growing up I used to use Finesse and I totally forgot how much I loved it. The shampoo is great. Normally with shampoo the curls tend to feel stringy and dry until the conditioner is used. But with Finesse it was smooth soft and felt very clean!
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"Received this for free from Influenster for an honest review, well #finesse was the same old Finesse from years ago. Scent is the same, but it does work. Not my fav but if you have shorter hair it might be ok, it leaves my long hair a bit tangley, guess that's why they included the conditioner ;)"
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"Thank you Influenster for this complimentary shampoo , it leaves my hair so soft and renewed, as well as smells amazing.

Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love pretty much everything about this shampoo, except the smell! It has hints of floral notes, then it just kind of smells like bug spray to me lol! It’s a pretty strong smelling shampoo! You only really smell the strong smell while washing your hair with it. It smells different after you’ve dried it and styled it! It makes my hair soft, and shiny. I do feel it’s strengthening my hair, so that is a great perk to using it! I’d totally recommend if you’re looking for a shampoo to strengthen your hair!"
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this shampoo and I also love how it make my hair feel after one use I feel like my hair been restore and I feel more strength to my hair. And it left my hair feel soft.
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,3 / 5,"Its just a very basic shampoo. Pleasant smell, reminds you of grandma in a good way. It felt like it stripped the oils from my hair and the conditioner did not help replenish, my hair still tangled. It will be a good back up for when my husband washes grease and oil off him after working"
Finesse Restore + Strengthen Moisturizing Shampoo,5 / 5,Received this from Influenster to review and share my feedback. This is a great drug store shampoo. It smells wonderful and left my hair super soft and manageable. Combing through was easy and no knots. Even hours later my hair still smells fantastic and its not puffy with the heat and humidity. This will certainly be purchased and used more

I'll continue to use until I learn more about hair products, but then it's getting tossed."
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,2 / 5,it was really good at first and now my hair gets oily quick. been using it for a long time and hasn’t failed me until recently. the first day hair is the best

Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,4 / 5,"This product did help control how quickly my hair got oily. Normally I wash my hair every day. With this product, I was able to go every other day. I hope it will become offered in other scents. Definitely best for oily hair. I am very satisfied."
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,5 / 5,I have long long hair but in hours my scalp gets oily. This shampoo has worked miracles. It has helped my hair be oily-free for longer.
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,3 / 5,"It didn’t do much for me. I give it 3 stars because I think head & shoulders makes some GREAT stuff, but this isn’t it."
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo worked for my oily hair for a lot longer than most! I was very impressed!
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,5 / 5,I didn’t like my hair how it became so oily. whenever I use other products it would leave me oily hair within 3 hours. This shampoo helped me to get rid of my oily hair. Good recommendation for instant oil control.
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,5 / 5,"In my opinion, all head and shoulder products are really good. I bought this shampoo randomly and its just as good as the other scents. It has a fresh lemon smell. It keeps my scalp from getting too dry. I will buy again in the future."
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo is my go to for everyday wash. Love the fresh clean smell and it does help to control oiliness
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,5 / 5,Definitely is the reason I don’t have dandruff anymore soothing and moisturizing for your scalp
Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Shampoo,3 / 5,"This product made my hair feel like straw. As it stripped all the oil out of my hair, It didn’t make my hair any less greasy the next day ( i’m a daily shampoo person). The upside is the thickness and lather of the product, that was nice."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Looking for a purple shampoo to eliminate all yellow? This is the one right here! This stuff is STRONG. Be careful because it will temporarily dye your hands purple. If you get it on your shower walls, make sure to rinse it off right away because leaving it will stain your shower. This stuff works though. It really helps eliminate brassy/yellow tones. I don’t care for the scent… but the effectiveness is what matters!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is absolutely brilliant stuff ,my hair gets brassy looking within a few weeks of getting it bleached and coloured, I put this on my hair and relax in the bath for a few minutes and I swear it gets rid of all that yellowish/ orange out of my hair ,just make sure you use gloves as it will colour your hands purple, I use this about once a week and the bottle lasts ages making it great value for money"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This is arguably the most effective purple hair shampoo on the market because it works impressively well!! It’s cost effective and hasn’t been too drying or damaging on my hair. It does however keep my hair perfectly icy blonde! When I leave it in for over 10 minutes it gives my hair this lavender silvery look tonight just love and can’t get enough of!! The scent is mild and flowery but fades after rinsing. The shampoo does dye my hands and finger nails but it fades about 80% after rinsing and within a day or two is usually completely fades. I’ve used a lot of purple shampoos and this is by far my favorite! I purchase it over my old go tos Kevin Murphy blonde angel and Kerastase blond absolu shampoo/conditioner. Fanola doesn’t smell as heavenly as Kerastase or Kevin Murphy but it works even better and is easier on my pocket!
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Das höchstpigmentierteste Silbershampoo auf dem Markt, erzielt den besten Effekt. Gibt einen tollen silbrigen Schimmer. Die blondierten Haare bekommen keinen Gelbstich mehr. Die Haare glänzen sehr schön seidig. Es schäumt gut auf und den Geruch ist sehr angenehm. Der Preis ist für eine so große Flasche absolut in Ordnung. Ich habe schon viele Silbershampoos ausprobiert und das ist definitiv das Beste! Alles in allem sehr empfehlenswert."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,This product was very helpful in the case of my yellow and orange tinted here I left it in and I had noticed a huge difference this was super affordable and smell friendly.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Das Shampoo ist echt ein Wunder. Nur eine Anwendung in der Woche und das Gelbstich ist Geschichte. Ich trage keine Handschuhe, weil die Hände nicht so extrem verfärbt werden. Die Haare brechen nicht ab und der Geruch ist schön angenehm. Der Preis für so eine große Flasche ist gerecht, da das Volumen für sehr lange Zeit reicht. Der Dosierkopf ist schön praktisch und lässt nur die benötigte Menge raus."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Fanola No Yellow Shampoo ist wirklich ein beeindruckendes Produkt mit hervorragenden Ergebnissen bei der Neutralisierung unerwünschter gelber Töne im blonden Haar. Die Farbqualität ist außergewöhnlich, was es zu einem der besten Shampoos in dieser Hinsicht macht. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass seine größte Schwäche darin liegt, dass es das Haar austrocknen kann, insbesondere wenn es zu häufig verwendet wird. Es wird empfohlen, nach der Anwendung eine sehr gute Haarmaske zu verwenden, um die Feuchtigkeit und Weichheit des Haares zu erhalten. 😄"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been using this shampoo for years! I love everything about it. It's really inexpensive and works extremely well. It smells very nice, and lasts for a while as you don't have to use it often. It's my holy grail for my long blonde hair."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Absolutely worth the money! Lasts ages as only needs to be used once a month to prevent build up and dull hair, smells AMAZING, and my hairdresser recommended this to me. Keeps my bleached hair light /brassiness at bay. Is almost like a toner. Only leave on for 3-5 mins though as your hair will turn violet for a few days!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,Shampoo viola anti giallo totalizzante indicato sui capelli grigi naturali o decolorati con schiariture o meches .. I pigmenti viola aiutano a neutralizzare i riflessi indesiderati gialli ! lasciare in posa dai 3 ai 5 min poi sciacquare si consiglia l utilizzo dei guanti 🧤
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"I cannot say enough good things about Fanola products! I have icy blonde, balayage hair and I haven't had my hair professionally colored in close to a year yet I still receive compliments on how vibrant the color is because of this shampoo. I save money from purchasing this due to the fact it allows me to get my hair colored (significantly!) less often. Even though I use the shampoo multiple times a week, a 11.8oz bottle will still last me close to 6 months or longer. My only complaint about this shampoo is that it can be very drying, like many purple shampoos. I advise investing in a high-quality conditioner to help alleviate the dryness."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,Does exactly what it needs to do - I’ve been using this for years on my bleached hair and always have people asking if I just got it done because of how bright it looks. I use this once a week. Just have to wash your hands after using it otherwise they’ll turn purple!!
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Das Fanola No Yellow Shampoo ist absolut fantastisch! Ich benutze es seit einiger Zeit, um meine blonden Strähnen aufzufrischen und unerwünschte Gelbtöne zu neutralisieren. Die Ergebnisse sind beeindruckend - meine Haare sehen nach jeder Anwendung viel kühler aus und fühlen sich super gepflegt an. Die Textur ist angenehm und es schäumt gut auf. Der Duft ist auch sehr angenehm. Insgesamt ein Muss für blondes Haar!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Fanola No Yellow Shampoo is like a miracle worker for blondes and those with lightened hair. It banishes those unwanted yellow tones, leaving your locks looking fresh and vibrant. Plus, it's super gentle on your hair, so you don't have to worry about drying it out. If you're a blonde, this shampoo is a miracle for keeping your color on point."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Lo shampoo anti-giallo che ho utilizzato ha superato le aspettative nel neutralizzare i toni indesiderati sui miei capelli biondi. La sua formulazione mirata ha ridotto efficacemente i riflessi gialli, lasciando i capelli luminosi e naturali. Ho notato anche un miglioramento nel mantenere i capelli più puliti!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Eines der besten Anti-Gelb-Shampoos, das ich benutzt habe. Es ist sehr pigmentiert, ich empfehle die Verwendung von Handschuhen bei der Anwendung auf dem Haar, da man sonst lila Hände und Nägel bekommt. Ich trage eine kleine Menge auf mein nasses Haar auf und lasse es etwa 3-5 Minuten einwirken. Dann spüle ich es aus und das war's. Sehr schnell und effektiv. Das Haar wird schön glatt und lässt sich leicht kämmen und stylen. Mein blondes Haar sieht schön und überhaupt nicht gelb aus."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"The fanola purple shampoo is my all time favorite! I’ve tried a lot of different purple shampoos, and this one by far is the best. Within seconds of putting it in my hair, my hands turn purple! But I’m okay with that, because it will wash away! ;) it just tells you how pigmented it is! It literally takes my brassiness out, and us blondes do NOT like brassy! A little bit goes a long way! Defiantly recommend to all fellow blondes, and or grey/white hair!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the BEST purple shampoo on the market. I am a natural brunette with VERY red undertones to my brown hair. I have money pieces that get yellow and brassy easily. I use this once a week to tone my hair and it truly does get rid of all of the brass. A whole bottle will last you a long time. My hair dresser recommended this to me.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,Beat purple shampoo i have ever used on my blonde hair. It definitely tones down yellow unwanted tones. Great value as come in huge bottles what lasts for ages. I was recommended it by my hairdresser and it definitely does the job.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Fantastic purple shampoo, very highly pigmented to say bye bye to those brassy yellow tones and help to clean blonde locks! I’ve used so many purple shampoos over the years and lots of them make my hair super dry, this one doesn’t do that at all and still look free of yellow! Would reccomend!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is the best purple shampoo I have ever used! Not only did it very quickly get rid of the yellow tones in my hair after a horrific salon experience, it is not drying on your hair and keeps the condition. Highly recommend!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,This used to be my no.1 silver shampoo. It tones the hair so well and you get cold/silver tones in your hair. But i feel like the ingredients changed since i got the one with purple cap on instead of white and it leaves me with heavy coated hair afterwards.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,Fanola no yellow shampoo is absolutely amazing at brightening blonde hair and lifting the brassiness and dullness! The scent is nice but do be aware it can stain your hands when you use it!
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"As a lifetime “blonde” I have used several different product lines to improve the tone of my color treated blonde hair. These have ranged from salon lines to basic lines of shampoo. The Fanola No Yellow shampoo is one of the best. After one of wash I saw a vast improvement and the brassiness was removed. The directions suggest wearing gloves, I did not but did experience some minor purple hint to my hands but this was able to be quickly removed with some scrubbing."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Ich finde das Shampoo super, wenn man blondiertes Haar wieder schön abmattieren möchte. Ich lasse es dazu 15 Minuten einwirken und wasche es anschließend mit einem Feuchtigkeitsshampoo aus. Meine Haare sind danach schön kühl und matt vom Blond. Allerdings trocknet das Shampoo die Haare aus und man sollte zusätzlich eine Spülung dazu verwenden. Fakt ist: es hilft definitiv gegen Gelbstich! Achtung: bei Anwendung unbedingt Handschuhe tragen!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"professional shampoo with purple tint very effective in reducing the yellow in blonde hair. it gives it a gray tint, which lasts until the next wash."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Un shampoo excelente para matizar el cabello amarillo.yo tengo hight Lightning color gris y mi cabello aveces se me pibe amarillo entonces uso este shampoo para matizar , lo dejo por 15 minutia .El precio es bueno para 350 ml.Packaging es bobillo viene con su cajita"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,Great product. Does its job just fine. But I can't get over how it dyes my fingers and cuticles purple. I use it just once in a while because my hair is not that brassy. So it doesn't make it dry
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is definitely THE BEST ""silver"" shampoos out there. I've tried so many different ones and not one compares to Fanola!! Does an amazing job, it smells lovely and even leaves your hair feeling great! (I find some similar shampoos can leave your hair feeling quite dry). I would 100/10 recommend this shampoo."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,Great purple shampoo. Does well to mute the yellow in my blonde hair. Smells like grape candy in a good way. Leaves my hair feeling light and clean.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Este champú te soluciona la vida si tienes el pelo teñido de rubio. Ahora en verano se me ha puesto más anaranjado y con este champú adiós a esos tonos feos. Es bastante asequible y dura muchísimo,así te ahorras de ir tanto a la peluquería para matizar. Lo recomiendo mucho!!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best purple shampoo for the best price! Do not leave it in your hair for more than a minute or your hair will turn purple bc it is so potent. You be able to use one bottle for forever bc of how little you need to keep your hair toned!
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,By far the most pigmented purple shampoo I've ever tried. Both me and my partner use this shampoo and we both agree that is the best so far. I have highlights and he has all-over silver hair. It gives us the best silver tone but we have to be careful as it can also make your hair very dry and brittle.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"This shampoo is probably one of the darkest pigmented purple shampoos you’ll find for toning blonde hair to a more ash finish. It IS strong, you will see more hair fallout in the shower when am washing it out so make sure to follow up with a leave in treatment mask. So so important especially for the ends of your hair. I find one bottle lasts me a full year and I will use it 1-2x/month. I’ve also used it as a mask on dry hai me and left it on for 30mins - that works the best for my hair but again it’s drying!!"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This has been my #1 favorite purple shampoo for the past few years. I have brown hair with light/blonde balayage and my daughter has blonde hair. This keeps the warmth and orange/copper tones away. It can stain your hands a bit if you don’t wash it off right away but it goes away. The scent is a little strong but I think it smells good. Sometimes I leave it for a few minutes and it makes the blonde a little lighter. They also have a purple hair mask/conditioner that works great with this. Definitely recommend!
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve had blonde dyed hair for 5+ years now. This is one of my absolute HOLY GRAIL! It has kept my blonde ashy and light by taking all brassiness away. I have long hair and tend to use a lot of product which is another reason why I love Fanola No Yellow Shampoo; they offer 1000 mL and 350 mL! I order it from Amazon and it’s very affordable in comparison to other purple shampoos! I have gone through 5+ bottles in my lifetime, one 1000 mL bottle has lasted me MONTHS! (Showering every other day). It truly does what it advertises, I am loyal to Fanola’s No Yellow Shampoo 🙌🏼"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"The shampoo is the maximum, I use it approximately every 10 to 15 days and it keeps the tone of my hair beautiful, I love my platinum tone, and the most important thing is that my hair looks healthy, all women ask me what I do to have my hair like this, well Fanolla"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,Ce shampoing violet est le meilleur pour moi. Il est extrêmement efficace pour éliminer les reflets jaunes des cheveux et aider à garder un blond bien froid et pur. Je l’apprécie également beaucoup car il n’assèche pas les cheveux. Essayez-le à tout prix vous n’en serez pas déçu(e)!
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Ist megaaa, ich liebe es meine Haare wirken genau schon Silber wie ich es will , kaufe mir den schon seit 5 Jahren ! Nur noch zum empfehlen !"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo was great when I had blonde hair. It eliminated yellow tones well without leaving a dark stain on the hair which can happen with some toning shampoos. I also like that it is ph balanced.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Most purple shampoos are pretty drying but this one on the other hand doesn’t seem to dry out your hair, I would say that it’s closer to just a regular shampoo as far as moisturizing. I enjoyed using this product because it didn’t over deposit purple tones into the hair. It is more of a maintenance shampoo because of that though, so if you have a lot of yellow in your hair it will not completely take that away."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,I have used this the last 7 years and always have to have this on hand. It’s affordable. My hair stylist suggests it. It has toned my hair to the silver blonde that I aim for and I love it more every time I wash it. It MAY leave purple hues depending how long you leave it on but I like it personally. (And it washes away the next wash if anything)
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,"Lightened my hair with Manic Panic 50 vol. lightener doe 40 minutes and then rinsed with the Fanola purple shampoo. I left it on for the recommended 5+ minutes while I shaved my legs, then I rinsed out. At first, my hair felt like straw (not a food feeling) but I finished up with Silkeé hair treatment conditioner which left my hair very smooth and manageable (there is no place to currently review this product). After air drying, my hair is much lighter and there is a noticeable difference between the pre-Fanola wash and the post-wash. There is still a bit of yellow still in my blonde, but it's probably unavoidable without a salon appointment. Overall, I am pleased. The smell is also very nice and floral, and lingers in the hair. I may or may not try this product again."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is the first purple shampoo which has actually worked for me. Any others just don’t seem to help or they make me itch. After getting my latest set of highlights, the bleach was taken off maybe a tad too early and I had yellow bits where they should have been white. My hairdresser couldn’t fit me in again and I’d tried every purple shampoo I could get hold of until my hairdresser recommended trying this shampoo. My god it is a miracle, how it turned my hair whiter I don’t know but I’m in love!! The only downside is that I now have purple nails."
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This is by far my favorite purple shampoo. It doesn’t dry my hair out and works like a charm! Most purple shampoos make my skin itchy but this one doesn’t.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,I remember my stylist telling me that she hopes I’m not using Shimmering Lights. Once I told her that I use Fanola she let out a sigh of relief. It’s highly pigmented and it really helps with brassiness. I usually mix some with my regular shampoo to create a nice lather. I’ll leave it on for a few minutes while I exfoliate/shave/etc. and my hair is icy again.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,4 / 5,"This is great purple shampoo. It gets rid of all brasiness. Iv been blonde my whole life and haven't found a better product. I wouldn't leave this any longer than 4 minutes or your hair will be over toned and purple in patches. I would also recommend wearing gloves or your hands and nails will turn purple/Grey! I use this once a week. I would give it 5 stars, but it is very drying. My hair is matted after washing it out. I wash with moisture shampoo before, use fanola, then wash again with moisture shampoo to get the residue out. And then use a moisture conditioner and leave on for a few minutes and have not had any damage issues with my hair"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This is one of my favorite purple shampoos ever!!! It’s highly pigmented and can temporarily leave a light purple tone to blonde hair if you leave it in too long but it will wash out. When I use this I don’t use gloves lol initially it’ll leave purple on my hands but by the time I’m done showering it’s gone. Also when I use this I primarily focus on my roots if there’s yellow then let the suds go through my length while rinse. I only let this sit on my hair 1-3 minutes max! I don’t want my blonde to be more silver. After using this I always follow up with another one of my shampoos and deep conditioners because this is drying. This leaves my blonde looking bright and the yellow tones down.
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,"Estoy maravillada con este producto. Lo obtuve en Amazon! Habia probado ya antes algunos otros productos para quitar ese color naranja de mi cabello y no funcionaban como esperaba, hasta que probé este!! Inicialmente me encanta que sea un shampoo y con esto ahorro pasos y tiempo en mi rutina de cabello! En un solo paso limpia y matiza. Recomiendan usarlo con guantes y Asi lo hice, matiza rápidamente entre 1-5min. En la imagen pueden ver el antes y después. Mi cabello paso de un tono muy naranja a uno mucho mas cenizo/platinado con solo una aplicación!! Solo es importante tomar en cuenta que el producto no funciona mucho para hidratar o cuidar el cabello como otros shampoos asi que recomiendo luego de usarlo, aplicar una mascarilla/acondicionador o tratamiento hidratante. 10/10"
Fanola No Yellow Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best purple shampoo. It keeps my blonde so icy between salon visits. It also smells really good! I use it about every 2 weeks to keep the yellow away
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,4 / 5,It makes my hair very shiny but it makes my hair very dry. The smell is very good and worth the price! It is easy to use and when you lather there are a lot of bubbles
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"The Mane n Tail shampoo smells really clean and nice! Not overwhelming at all, and I have a sensitive nose. It's one of the products I always have in my shower because it's basic enough to not flare any of my sensitivities, and the paired conditioner makes my hair so soft. My scalp gets fairly oily/weighed down quickly, while my hair itself can get frizzy and a bit dry. Just a good all-rounder to have when I want to cut back to the basics! It's also a great value for how much you get, and it honestly doesn't feel ""cheap"" either. You should definitely try it out if you have the same criteria as me! 🖤"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"This is literally the best shampoo for people who have coarse, straight hair. It cleans hair really well without stripping it and also doesn't strip color from dyed hair (mine is dyed red, so that's especially important to me)."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,1 / 5,"I bought this item and tried it out years ago due to the claims out there. Let me tell you, my hair never felt clean, fuller or shinier. There was no positive effect, if anything, it was contributing to more issues. I used it for months and finally gave up. I’ll never understand the hype behind it. I’m not a horse, so maybe that’s the problem."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,4 / 5,The shampoo is a bit stripping but my waves love it so much! It helps to add volume and moisture to my hair and gives new life to my hair...who new it could hold a style? It didn't before but it does now...large bottles with a price thats easy on the pocket book so its hard to go wrong with it
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Been using mane n tail for a few years now, my family loves it, I love it. It cleans but doesn't strip, and it's hydrating and moisturizing. Use their regular shampoo and conditioner, as well as the deep moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I am very satisfied with their product and will continue to use it on my family."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"It’s a very great product for human hair and dogs or other animals I’ve used it for many years and love it each time I use it, the smell is great also! Never a bad decision with this shampoo or conditioner!! It’s really great and worth the hype!"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,I have used this shampoo since it was little. I have very curly hair and I find that this really is one of the few shampoo that will really get me a deep clean feeling. They smell is very nice and not overwhelming and doesn’t leave any residue. The price point is good and can find at a lot of places. I would definitely recommend!
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Is the best shampoo if you want to long hair. Your hair is perfect, soft and bright. Help with the loss to hair"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,3 / 5,"Supposedly, this is THE STUFF for long hair, and you do get a whole lot of shampoo for the price, but I didn't care for the texture it gave my hair. Not Your Mother's Way To Grow is also good for growth, but left my hair much softer."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,Very nice product along with the conditioner. Will leave your pet with a clean shiny coat .
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,The only shampoo I will use on my horses! Always a fresh scent. Easy to rinse out. Now a new sleek and shiny version! So great!
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,I absolutely love it it’s made my hair feel so nice and soft￼ it feels amazing after would you would not think that being a horse shampoo and it is really good on my horse I love it I smell like them all the time
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Time to get my hair growing faster! Sounds odd but that's exactly what this shampoo does for me. Makes my hair stronger and longer! It has a weird gel texture and doesn't smell the greatest but we have to remember it was originally made for horses😂. I used this a few days after bleaching my roots once, and after my shower I could already see new roots coming in. I'm coming back to it after having my son, which created a bunch of baby hair flyaways around my face."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,I swear by this! No other shampoo cleans your scalp like this without drying it out . And with the conditioner it makes my hair grow like crazy ! I would recommend all of their products !
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,Mane n Tail makes my dog smell better than any other grooming brand I’ve tried. It keeps him incredibly shiny and soft. I use the conditioner as a leave-in on him and it’s made his coat super healthy looking.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,2 / 5,The shampoo smells good it’s a good shampoo but if you’re expecting it to make your hair stronger and longer in my experience it did not do that so if you just want it for a shampoo it’ll work for you but if you were expecting more it disappointed me￼
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,4 / 5,I used this product for a few months and just recently changed my hair products (not because of the product but because I like to change up my hair care every few months because it’s good for your hair to do so). I feel like it is very much hyped up but it does the job. For the first month I used this it did a good job at making my hair feel and look healthy but over time it seemed to make my hair oily.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"This Shampoo helps grow your hair faster, reduces as well as repairs. You do not need much of this shampoo because it will lather so a little does go a long ways. Over all it is just a great product that been around for a really long time and I have been using it for years and years."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,3 / 5,I enjoyed using this but I didn’t notice any more growth or faster growth than with other shampoos that I’ve used.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,This product helped me get my curl pattern back after heat damage. It hydrated and moisturizes your hair leaving it shiny✨
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Good for pets and humans equally, first used this product on myself years ago and it was nice but definitely needs to be followed with a conditioner. For pets the jelly like texture is perfect and easy to distribute but make sire you rinse it put multiple times!"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Very good shampoo! Love to use it on my dog, works well so far. Haven’t had any concerns about it. There’s nothing I would change about Mane ‘N Tail. I recommend it %100"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,Love this shampoo! I have really dry hair it helps my scalp from getting itchy. Love the smell and the it isn’t too pricey.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,Before this product I used Pantene and it was harsh on my hair. It would make it fall out and make small pimples come out on my scalp. After trying this product my hair started to grow and I believe it made it shiny. My curls automatically turn nice once out the shower where before it would just frizz up.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,4 / 5,"This shampoo works really well depending on the texture of your hair, I feel. I have very very very fine hair and found my hair was always dry, always breaking no matter how much oil I would soak it in and I started to get some moisture back when I switched shampoos. My husband on the other hand has very thick, beautiful hair and this shampoo makes his hair incredibly dreamy. It’s an intense shampoo that works really well, for thicker hair! The price is also really good for the amount you get. Here we pay $10 for a huge bottle."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,This shampoo has helped bring my hair from weak to stronger. I suffer from PCOS and some times my hair get really weak this helped a lot with my last episode!
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Es un shampoo increíble, deja suave y brillante el cabello de tu caballo, lo recomiendo mucho. Lo llevo comprando desde hace ya mucho tiempo, y nunca me ha fallado, mis caballos siempre están con muy buen olor y limpios, además es de buena marca, lo recomiendo mucho de verdad 🤩🤩🤩"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"Smells good, cleans just as good. You get a lot of product for a decent price. Can be purchased at most stores even Walmart [product:original-mane-‘n-tail-shampoo]"

Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,I love this [product:mane-'n-tail®-daily-control-anti-dandruff-shampoo-16-oz.] for my dog because it gets all the dirt and dander from his fur. Not much has to be used which is good and my dog is about 75lbs. Great amount of formula to clean the fur and clean their skin as well. Makes the fur shine but may feel a bit dry but that's ok just follow with the conditioner.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,I have been using this shampoo for many years and it’s what has helped me keep my hair healthy. It helps thicken and moisturize my hair.

Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,3 / 5,"I used this shampoo and conditioner for years. I mean years. I was told it will help thicken my thin fine hair. Its not thinning im not that old, but i have had thin fine hair all my life. I would love to find that miracle product that works for me. I have resorted to trying vitamins because your hair is only as healthy as your body and the vitamins and minerals you consume. I consume way too much sugar and I read that sugar can thin and cause hair to fall out. So I have stopped that and started to watch what I am eating."

Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,4 / 5,I bought this product in hopes of regaining my postpartum hair loss and I'm very satisfied. I'm at about 4 months of using the product and my hair is getting thicker. I would wish for a bit more shine. I have curly hair and at first my hair had to adjust to it but now my hair is full and has a lot body.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"I love this product! I have been using it for more than a year now, I noticed that my hair is growing at a faster pace. Little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts longer than usual shampoos. It is an absolute must have in my hair routine and it smells amazing! The price is reasonable."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,4 / 5,Honestly- I grew up on a farm washing our horses with this specific shampoo. I’ve never used it on myself until recently- & couldn’t be happier! I found it at Walmart for $15. Leaves your hair silky smooth & conditions- even without a conditioner after washing. My hair has been so dry & brittle lately- but this shampoo has been a saviour!
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,I absolutely love this product. It has a very nice lather and scent. The big bottles will last you a Long long time and thats why the price is so amazing. It just keeps my hair fresh and detangled. Furthermore it doesn’t strip my hair of its natural oils.
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"I use this product as a wash for my dogs and cats as it can be used for that, I have used on my hair wavy thick and curly, and it left me hair feeling very clean and refreshed, but I mostly use it for my animals and their fur is left super fluffy!"
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,2 / 5,"I tried this product with hopes that it would support hair growth. However, I find it to be very drying and leaves my hair feeling tangled and rough. My hair does not have any additional shine after using or softness. As for scent, it is light and pleasant. As for quantity, I find that I need to use a lot of product to get a good lather and for it to get to all my hair."
Mane 'n Tail® Shampoo Gallon,5 / 5,"[product:original-mane-n-tail-shampoo] es un buen shampoo ideal si buscas hacer crecer tu cabello , lo compré para ponerlo aprueba y ver si realmente hacía crecer el cabello y vaya que lo hizo , lo probé y a la 3 semana vi que mi cabello estaba un poco más largo , a demás te lo deja suave y con un brillo muy bonito, 100% recomendado para hacer crecer el cabello ."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,This product hd helped my hair and my kids hairs amazingly! It smells so good and the bottle is amazing! It has done nothing but grew out hair and keeps it moisturized.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"My go to shampoo!! I love the rose scent, I LOVE the bottle and how you can just put the applicator against your scalp and make sure to get a great lather on the scalp, I love love love that the first ingredient is water and not alcohol or anything else drying."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,This shampoo I really wanted to love but it has a very strong scent that’s kinda nauseating to me. The rose fragrance is really strong. It lasts on the hair for a few days. So if you are sensitive to strong scents I don’t recommend. The product itself is okay. I like that it cleanses the hair very very well. It’s leaves your hair and scalp squeaky clean. The downside to that however is it leaves the hair very dry because of how well it cleanses. You must use this in conjunction with the Rose Water conditioner to re-moisturize the hair. If not it will be a dry mess. But once the conditioner is applied the hair is much better. That and the smell were the only downside to me.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,Love the bottle and consistency of this shampoo. I actually feel like I can get product on my scalp (which is something I struggle with sometimes). I do go through it quicker though bc of this. I use on days I haven’t washed my hair- like 3-5 days without and I have buildup and my scalp starts to hurt. My only gripe is that I haven’t been able to find this near me recently.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"I’ve got fine 4b hair and I found this shampoo worked great for me! I used it after taking out some old braids and it was super effective at getting all the build up out. I love the nozzle and I appreciate the size of the bottle (even though it is kind of difficult to use in the shower). I feel like regular thick shampoos are heavy on my hair since the strands are fine and I have to be really attentive to get the shampoo washed out completely. With this product, I didn’t feel the need to do a second rinse after. It’s not perfect (it does leave your hair feeling stripped), but it’s the most interesting shampoo I’ve tried in a while."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,This gives a nice deep clean. Keep in mind the first wash is not going to lather much but the second one will. It smells so good and left my scalp and hair very clean. Follow up with deep conditioner afterwards
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I love the way that it lathers. This shampoo is unique because it starts of as a liquid then foams as you work it into your hair. The scent is very nice as well. The tip on the bottle makes it easier to reach your roots especially when you're wearing a protective style.[product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-with-rose-water]
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"This is the first shampoo that I've had in this type of bottle and I love it so much. It makes my wash days so much easier and leaves my scalp feeling refreshed. I usually feel like I'm using too much shampoo, but this allows me to get out exactly what I need."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,1 / 5,"I don’t really like this product personally, it did give me dandruff. I don’t know if maybe I’m using it wrong but i also don’t wash my hair regularly￼ hence since my natural hair is curly. I wanted to start my curly hair journey (wearing it natural) cause I got tire of damaging it.. I decided To do some research and all over TikTok people are raving about this product so I caved in and bought it but it is so bad I don’t know￼"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,"Not too bad. I have to use quite a bit on the scalp to get any results from it, and the fragrance is kind of overwhelming at first. I love the fact that I can add it directly to the scalp with the nozzle."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,I love this shampoo! Especially that it has a nozzle perfect for the scalp. It lathers up quickly too and since it’s liquid you don’t use too much. The smell is a little overbearing but not too bad.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,You must buy this. It smells wonderful. Hair feels really clean after and a little goes a long way when using it.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I love the way this makes my scalp feel and my squeaky clean curls makes for a great wash and go on clean hair. Have purchased twice will purchase again.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I was a little hesitant to give this a try. From it first appearance it makes you worry will it actually do the job and would it actually be enough. I think this is a great product if you have oily hair. I've only tried a few time but its not bad there is always room for improvement
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I used this on my daughter’s hair and it was very gentle on her and very light product. Easy to comb as it didn’t tangle up during wash and her hair is prone to tangle with her curl texture. Leaves the hair feeling soft and lightly fragrant. Overall love the product and added it to our hair routine. Received product complimentary for testing purposes.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I seriously fell in love with this shampoo! I love how it’s basically water that turns into soap!

Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,love how clean it leave my hair feeling... it feels a bit dry after the shampoo use but try the conditioner takes care of of that .. ok love how the shampoo changes from a water consistency to foam
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,3 / 5,"This dried my hair out, not because it didn’t work for me, doesn’t mean it might work for someone else. I’m not a fan of the strong floral scent."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"I loved using Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight. It didn't strip my hair and it left it feeling clean and manageable. I loved the way it felt and looked after use. Compared to other wash day products, it was quick and easy."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,3 / 5,"I enjoyed the smell of this product but it was quite a harsh cleanser! A little but truly goes a long way though. If you’re looking for a clarifying shampoo to get rid of heavy product build up, this is your product. On its own it’s a lot, but the conditioner helped!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,1 / 5,Honestly was not at all a fan of this. I had to use significantly more product than I would have with a regular shampoo. It was just way too liquidy and felt like I was just pouring water into my hair. I don’t think I would buy this to be honest
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,It breaks down the dirt easily in the hair. The smell is not overwhelming and my hair felt clean after use with no residue let over.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,The scent of rose is OVERPOWERING with this product but it does wonders on my toddler's fine hair. The lather is insane and the way it defines her curls and leaves her hair shiny is phenomenal. It was extremely drying for my own hair.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,Me gusto mucho este tratamiento dejo mi pelo tan bonito y mis rizos definidos casi no se como cuidar mi cabello rizado pero gracias a Influenster por la oportunidad de probar esto me encantó el resultado de mi cabello 😍😍😍
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,2 / 5,I didn’t really care for this product. The consistency is really thin. My hair didn’t feel clean after using. I have type 4A hair and had to rewash it
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,3 / 5,"This had great potential, but it fell short for me. It left my hair feeling dry. It has a nice smell though."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,2 / 5,I understand this is water to shampoo but it never changed to shampoo no matter how much I scrubbed my hair. It made my hair feel very dry and brittle. It made it feel like it damaged my hair instead of actually wash it. The scent is also not appealing. I had to wash this shampoo out with something else so my hair doesn’t stink. I don’t recommend.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I like how it deep cleans your hair and leaves it free of dirt or other products. I only wish you could leave the conditioner it's paired with in.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"Oh my goodness!! I am a curly girl and enjoy wearing my hair in all different styles. I used to do a lot of straightening but I’m trying to embrace my curls and this product is absolutely amazing!! I will continue to buy this product. It is the perfect formula and cleanses the hair, it also has the perfect nozzle applicator. [product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-with-rose-water]"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"Ladies and gents meet your new best from. It come in an additional scent, but the deal is your scalp feels squeaky clean, it lathers just right not a ton of suds. So happy I have been searching this with all my friends and family."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I've been using this product for 2 months now on my 2 daughters and fiance they live it. It makes their hair so soft and easy to brush. I cant wait to try other ones by this brand. So far I've only used the rose shampoo and conditioner
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,"My super coily headed daughter and I love this stuff! The applicator is what I never knew I needed in this hair care journey. It allows me to apply it deep in my daughter's roots where it can be hard to reach sometimes. It gets out all of the residue and leaves a lovely scent in the hair. It comes out watery at first and, like alot of shampoos I have experienced, it lathers better the second wash. I want to try the other scent next time it was sold out at target. Would recommend and will purchase again along with the Conditioner."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,The precision tip makes application so easy & gets to the scalp good. Smells just like roses & made my hair so soft !! 10/10
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,"I will say there is no denying that this product will keep your hair clean! And the rose smell is so nice and feminine! However as a natural hair girl, I will say that it's not a product you can use regularly in your curls. The micellar like structure it's very purifying which means I feel like it almost strips my hair completely of all oils... which can be a great thing when you're looking to clarify your hair! However it's not something I can use to regularly wash my hair because my hair is prone to being dry. I use this when I need a DEEP wash or my scalp is in need of deep cleaning like after braided styles. If I use this on my natural hair I'm just sure to DEEP condition after."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I really wanna try this product can u send me the vobox plz I wanna try it cuz my hair is wavy and kinda curly l.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,"So I got this to try on my daughters hair , she has a lot of her and very curly and I try to find things that are more less chemical that won’t damage her hair and help it grow. So I got this and what I like about it is that it literally goes in the hair like liquid which makes it easy to distribute and then it turns in to foam when u rub it in !! Also it has rose water which helps with hair growth the only thing that is not so pleasant for me is the flowery scent.. it’s a little much but other then that it has been great for my daughters hair"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,3 / 5,This shampoo is really good. When I first used this product I was amazed at how foamy and a gentle it is. Even with my dry hair it works really well and a little goes a long way. I would definitely buy it again.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I am currently using this and love it. U wouldn't think that it would lather up so well but it does and the smell isn't over powering. It's light enough but strong enough to feel clean.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"I have 3a/3b curly hair. I’ve used this a few times now, and so far I’m loving it! My hair feels so clean after using it, without feeling dry. It’s a micellar shampoo, but lathers really well. And the applicator tip is an awesome bonus. The o my thing I don’t love is the scent, which is a light rose scent. It’s not bad, I just don’t typically like floral scents!"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,2 / 5,"My Sunday wash and go, I’ll always trust my @mixedchickshair shampoo and products, the shampoo with 🥑 always help when I try a new shampoo and I have to go back and cleanse with moisture, although I like @carolsdaughter products but this wash day delight shampoo didn’t give me moisture and hydration but it did remove buildup. I like the conditioner smells amazing. I purchased all products myself from @target so sorry I wanted to like this shampoo [product:carols-daughter-wash-day-delight-sulfate-free-shampoo-with-rose-water]"
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,3 / 5,"Not in love with it, may have to try it again. I tried using it after I took out braids didn’t feel like it was doing anything. Maybe because I love a good lather. I love the smell though. I would not buy it ."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,This is a really good shampoo. i love how it turns from waterlike to great lather. It cleanses really well but does not strip your hair dry. I have not had any issues with it and I have used it about 4 times now. i will definitely recommend
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,2 / 5,"I am surprised about this from Carol's Daughter. I tried the shampoo along with the conditioner. This shampoo is extremely drying to my hair and the smell was unpleasant to me. Provided no moisture at all to my short, natural and very dry hair. I feel as though that what little natural oils I had in my hair had all been stipped away and left behind a not so natural rose scent. I used once and that was enough for me. Sorry, but very disappointing."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,3 / 5,Nice shampoo but very thin like water so that is hard to get used to. Weird applicator as well.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,"I received this complementary from Influenster. My hair is thick as all heck. Being able to use the pointed nozzle to put shampoo directly on my scalp makes life so much easier. It felt amazing on my scalp and smelled phenomenal. The only downside is that it didn’t really make detangling any easier. My hair was squeaky clean, though."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo, it's great for my hair type and doesn't strip my hair of it's moisture. The smell is nice too, this brand has several great products for natural hair care."
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I'm didn't think I would care for this product cause it has a different type of scent. Dont get me wrong its not a harsh or overly floral scent but its smells almost as if it was medicated. Its now my only shampoo and conditioner. LOVE IT!
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,I love the packaging. I love the scent. It is a great product for dry scalp. It is affordable. You get a lot of product for your money. It targets build up of product. It makes my hair feel lightweight. This shampoo makes my hair feel so clean and fresh.
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,5 / 5,
Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Shampoo with Rose Water,4 / 5,This product smells great! I love how it goes from liquid to instant foam when applied directly to my scalp. The only issue us my hair soaks up water so in order for it to lather really good I had to be under the water when in the shower. This product will be great for quick wash days
Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,5 / 5,"Every time I was my hair with this shampoo, people ask me what I use. This product smells SO GOOD!! It also makes my dull hair appear more vibrant and feel healthier. I like the large bottle (1.06 quart) because I don’t have to run out and buy more frequently and it’s just cost effective. It has keratin protein and great for my damaged hair and split ends."

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,5 / 5,"I purchased the travel size version of this shampoo to take away on holiday. Having tried other versions by this brand, as I was on holiday and knew my hair would be affected by a change in the climate this was a good choice. The shampoo was lightly fragrances and left my hair soft, moisturised and manageable. I would definitely look at taking this away again, especially when I know that my hair is going to have extreme changes."
Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,4 / 5,Es un shampoo qué ayuda mucho a controlar el frizz en cabellos muy dañados Su rendimiento por envase es muy bueno ya qué se utiliza poca cantidad de producto Limpia a profundidad
Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,4 / 5,"This shampoo was sent to me with a purchase and I may be hooked. The scent is similar to baby powder and I’m not sure if that is an upside or downside.

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,4 / 5,"After using a clarifying shampoo that didn’t agree with my hair, my 2C/3A curls were lifeless and fried. This totally brought my hair back to life! Unlike Olaplex, it doesn’t leave a weird coating and also doesn’t appear to strip out my red hair dye. The only downside is with repeated usage I noticed my hair becoming a little dry. If you are protein sensitive, I’d recommend using this every other shampoo or tossing in a mask every now and then to get some moisture back into your hair."

I honestly love the smell of the shampoo during and after. My husband and son complement the smell of my hair when I use this shampoo. My hair texture has improved. I feel like I have less frizz and my hair seems to be more healthy. The only downside of this shampoo I can think of is that it contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate. I don’t typically buy shampoo with sulfates. If it’s on sale, it doesn’t hurt to try it. Thank you, Nexxus! Please consider taking Sulfates out."
Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,5 / 5,Got this during a sale & loved it at first use. Really like how this lathers up in the hair. You can feel your hair repairing as you wash. My hair felt so clean & smooth after drying. This is one of my favorite hair care purchases this year thus far!
Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,5 / 5,This made my.hair feel so clean and soft and it smells so amazing. Just like the conditioner i dont have any at the moment but i will be.purchasing again soon. I think its a tiny bit pricey but you gotta be willing to spend the money for good hair.

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,5 / 5,"I never expect to be completely satisfied with any new hair care product I start to use…knowing that it does and will take time to learn how to use it properly for your hair type. Consistency is also key to see improvement. However, this shampoo,.. no joke… drastically improved my hair in ONE wash. By the time I was out of the shower and blow drying my hair, I could not stop bing in awe of how amazing & healthy my hair looked already. I have fairly bad split ends & wavy, medium to thick hair. It almost always takes other comparable shampoos at least a month or more to see the real improvement, if any. I am witness to this holy grail gifted to us by Nexxus… WORTH EVERY PENNY!"
Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,2 / 5,"I love the brand but this particular shampoo makes my hair feel greasy and weighed down, likes I just wash my hair with conditioner. Will be returning the unused bottles"

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,3 / 5,"I wrote very similar review for the complementing conditioner since I was using them together. This is not a bad shampoo but as something meant for damaged hair I expected more. I don’t think it was hydrating enough and I didn’t notice any improvement in my hair. It smells nice and it didn’t make my hair worse, in other words - another drugstore mediocre product. Personally, Pantene does better work for me. If you can spend a little bit more go for Redken Extreme."

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,3 / 5,"My hair has been through a lot so I thought I would give this a try. While it does seem to help with the damage a bit, it pulls dye out so fast. My hair isnt a fashion color right now, just blue black, but everytime I washed with this the water would run blue and my hair seemed to lose the shine pretty quickly. If you have dyed hair I say skill this one."

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,2 / 5,I got this on sale at Sally's beauty supply two for 12 dollars and honestly I was skeptical 🤨. It's made with 90% proteins to help prime the hair for deeper treatment. The first bottle I used was amazing but the second bottle WILL NOT RINSE OUT OF MY HAIR COMPLETELY!! Leaving huge greasy spots in my hair as seen in the photo...no matter how much I rinse and rub and rinse this awful mess us the result!! And I cannot tell until I start blow drying my hair! #nexus check in with you're manufacturer's because something is SERIOUSLY WRONG NOW.

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,5 / 5,I started using this shampoo about two months ago and it is amazing. I have thin fine straight hair and was starting to see the signs of thinning.

I also colour my hair and it doesn't dull the colour at all. I'm absolutely in love with this shampoo and conditioner

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,4 / 5,Love the nexxus products! They really helped repair my hair. The only reason I stopped using it is working and Goodyear and mixing the rubber smell with the “chemical” smell of nexxus did not end very well! #haircare #shampoo #beauty

Nexxus Keraphix Shampoo for Damaged Hair,3 / 5,I have really mixed reviews about this. I think for the first week it worked really well and then it didn’t. I think what’s important is that you rinse all the product out of your hair thoroughly to achieve best results. Don’t use too much. It doesn’t sudd up quickly so can’t just rub this into your hair and expect it to have sudds. The best way to do it is rub it in between your palms first and then wash your hair with the shampoo. Can be too heavy on fine thin hair

Function of Beauty Wavy Hair Shampoo Base with Fermented Rice Water - 11 fl oz,1 / 5,"This haircare line really caught my eye, it was just so different! It was unique, i was attracted to it for the simple fact that each product could be formulated to your personal needs. I loved the overall concept, and it smelled fantastic! I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in treatment. I also grabbed boosters, and used two for each base, strength, deep condition, and frizzy hair. So first thing I noticed was nothing. It did nothing to my hair. My hair was frizzy, crazier than usual. And didn’t feel any healthier with the boosters. deep condition and strengthening boosters along with frizzy hair did nothing at all. On top of the disappointment, I developed sores all over my scalp. But wait it gets worst… my hair began to fall out in clumps. There was hair everywhere including every room I entered. Awful!!! I know everyone reacts different to products, but I just simply wouldn’t recommend this brand to anyone period!!!"

Gifted by Ouai"
OUAI Detox Shampoo 10 oz/ 300 mL,5 / 5,"I thought this did a really excellent job of cleansing my scalp without stripping my hair. I like the scent of the shampoo very much, but it didn’t last after the shower for very long. I think this is quite expensive for shampoo."

OUAI Detox Shampoo 10 oz/ 300 mL,4 / 5,As you can see my Ouai Detox shampoo got alot of love. I purchased mine from Sephora for $32 and have been using consistently for about 6 months.

I usually only wash my hair once a week because I dye it black and I have really white hair at the age of 31 so I like to keep my color in. it gets all the oil out of my hair or any products that I was using! It also smells amazing. It’s a little pricey, but it is worth it. I highly recommend if you have oily hair or if you use a lot of products in your hair."

OUAI Detox Shampoo 10 oz/ 300 mL,5 / 5,"I will never not have this shampoo on standby! My hair needs a ton of help from other products when it comes to day-to-day styling. After a while, I get horrible build up and residue from my texture sprays, deep conditioners, masks, and more. An employee at one of my local beauty stores suggested Ouai and I'll forever be grateful she did! This product stripped all of that nasty oil and gunk from my fine hair and it felt so nice and light afterwards. Other detoxing shampoo iced used has been harsh and left my hair brittle and dull. Not this! Keep in mind, this is not something to use every day. I like to use it once every one to two weeks depending on how much I need it and I follow it up with the Ouai leave-in conditioner."
OUAI Detox Shampoo 10 oz/ 300 mL,5 / 5,Amazing smell just like the rest of the ouai products! Really deep cleans your scalp and helps remove any dry shampoo or product buildup. Big bottle is also very aesthetically pleasing in my shower lol.

Pantene Pro-V Full and Strong Shampoo,5 / 5,"Beyond that, I tested all the fun stuff (the scent it will leave lingering) and the practical stuff, too (the value you’re getting). I’ve used several of these shampoos for weeks or months at a time, but the parameters I looked for were always the same: How clean does my hair feel, how healthy does my hair feel, and does it have that shine and bounce that I crave?"
Pantene Pro-V Full and Strong Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve been using Pantene shampoo for a while now, and overall, it’s been a positive experience. The product delivers on its promise of leaving hair feeling clean, soft, and manageable. I especially appreciate the rich, creamy formula that lathers easily, making it feel luxurious during application. One of the standout features is the scent – it’s fresh and long-lasting without being overpowering. My hair also feels noticeably smoother and shinier after consistent use, which is a big plus. However, for those with sensitive scalps or specific hair concerns (like dryness or dandruff), it might not be the best fit, as some of the formulas can feel heavy or leave slight residue if not rinsed thoroughly. Overall, Pantene shampoo is a great option for everyday use, especially for those seeking affordable and effective hair care."

Alles in allem eine solide Option, wenn man ein preiswertes Shampoo sucht, das Volumen und einen angenehmen Duft bietet."

Pantene Pro-V Full and Strong Shampoo,3 / 5,I found this to be too smoothing for my hair that I loose all volume and my hair is too sleek. It sticks to my face and lacks so much frizz it is too straight for my liking. I have naturally black straight hair and so I don’t mind a little bit of frizz as it helps me with my volume (don’t know if you can relate). So even though this is volumizing I didn’t find it to work for me. I will probably look for a clean brand as shampoo that doesn’t foam up or have harsh chemicals next.

However, this shampoo left my hair shiny but not greasy, smelling amazing, soft and light! When compared to other shampoos/comditioners that do the same things, it is cheaper!"
OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo smells so good and leaves your hair extremely soft and shiny. My only downside was that it feels like it dries out my scalp a bit. You get what you pay for - with cheaper shampoos, you usually have to use more product, so the product runs out quicker. Has probably lasted me 2 months and I’m more than half way through."

OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,1 / 5,Made my hair fall out and left my scalp with chemical burns. It was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had with hair care if not the worst. Save yourself the hassle and save your money. Don’t use this.
OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,I’m loving the OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo! Not only does it contain biotin and collagen but also contains bamboo fiber extract and hydrolyzed wheat protein. The scent isn’t overpowering but just the right amount of sweet and fresh.

OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo does give a lot of volume, noticeably. The scent is light and inoffensive. It didn’t strip my scalp at all, I was worried it would. It didn’t irritate my very sensitive scalp which is great. Two gripes I have about it is that after the shampooing process in the shower, I didn’t find my hair to be as manageable as it would be if I had used something like Pantene. More tangles in my hair. I can manage this with leave in product, though. I think if you don’t have extremely dry hair and a dry scalp, and you’re looking exclusively for volume, this is a winner."
OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,The smell is amazing and I swore by this product before o moved and had someone destroy the color of my hair and needed to have a color correction on it and my hair was needing a new and more effective product needed for my hair color and texture or I would have never stopped using this product and the brand is affordable and the bottles are very good and luxurious for the price
OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,2 / 5,I didn’t like this at all. It made my hair greasy and I gave it away. The smell was fine and packaging is pretty. But I am not a fan of this brand in general
OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,3 / 5,A really inoffensive shampoo. It didn’t wow me but it did serve its purpose well enough. It wouldn’t be my first choice but it wouldn’t be a major no. I did receive this product with the purpose of reviewing.

OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,5 / 5,"I particularly enjoy the smell of this shampoo, it’s very sweet for me, but unfortunately it doesn’t last long.

Anyway, I still wanna use it mixing up with another kinds of hair serums, it works better."
OGX Extra Strength Biotin & Collagen Shampoo,4 / 5,This shampoo worked fairly well for me. The ingredients are decent. My sensitive scalp would still get a little flaky The price was okay for how long it lasted.

Even though I've only tried this shampoo and conditioner one time, I really enjoyed it and could tell a difference in my hair. The shampoo has a very pearl like texture that smells fantastic. It is sulfate free, so it did not have that much lather. It's one of those sulfate-free shampoos that just kind of cleanses your hair but doesn't soap up. It did seem to do a very good job cleansing my scalp. The conditioner was very thick and also smelled wonderful. It left my hair feeling silky smoothly. I normally have a lot of tangles whenever I get out of the shower, but my brush glides through my hair tangle free after using this duo. After blow drying my hair, I could tell a significant difference in my hair's texture. It does not have as much frizz. My hair smelled clean and refreshed. I would definitely purchase this great shampoo and conditioner set."

Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo to me is a clarifying shampoo, it says moisture repair but to me it wasn’t that moisturizing, a little goes a long way, I felt my hair getting thoroughly clean while using this, I focus mainly on my scalp but as I’m running the suds through the length of my hair I could feel it cleaning my strands thoroughly which I like since I’m going on 2weeks since I last washed my hair, I only washed my hair once & I know if I went with a second cleanse my hair would’ve been stripped from all its oils since again to me this is a clarifying shampoo, since this is a deluxe sample if I would have the full bottle I would use it as a clarifying shampoo to clean my hair & scalp when my scalp & hair is super dirty, I didn’t mind the smell, this is a good product."

The shampoo effectively cleanses without stripping moisture, leaving hair feeling refreshed. The conditioner deeply nourishes and repairs, resulting in silky, manageable strands. The Moroccan oil adds a luxurious touch, promoting shine and taming frizz. Together, they create a rejuvenating haircare routine, especially beneficial for dry or damaged hair.

Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo makes my hair so smooth and silky! I have keratin-treated hair and this is one of the few shampoos that doesn’t degrade the keratin.

Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,4 / 5,"I bought it for my daughter who has very thick, dry and curly hair. She likes this shampoo : her hair feels soft and smells amazing after using it. But her only concern is that she has more dandruff with this shampoo. Then she stopped using it and keeper the Moroccanoil Repair mask that she found amazing!"
Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,"I tend to rotate between Moisture Repair, Hydrating, and Smoothing depending on store selection and time of year. You cannot go wrong with any of them. The moisture repair is really good for damage and does not leave a lot of residue. The scent is obviously amazing. The first time I use the shampoo I felt like I was back in Hawaii and switch to it! The only other one I use is Oribe ￼ but my families overall shampoo is Moroccan Oil!"
Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,"I got sucked into co-washing and the fear mongering around sulfates, and I ended up with hair that was extremely dry no matter what I did. I was constantly trying to add more products moisturize it with no success. I finally saw a video explaining that without a good cleanse, those moisturizing ingredients are not able to penetrate the hair. I picked this up, shampooed twice back to back, and my hair has not looked this HYDRATED in years. It finally has movement again! My hair was so stiff and dull for soooo long, so glad I found this!"
Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,Repairs damaged & frizzy hair. Also helps with oily scalp. Use it with conditioner or the mask for better results. I have tried all lines from this brand and found moisture repair & smoothing the best. Hydrating one is not for people who have oily scalp so it didn't work for me but people with dry scalp must try.
Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,"Throughout my hair care journey I have tried what feels like a million shampoos but this one is in my top few. I also love the hydrating shampoo but either way, no matter your hair concern, Moroccanoil will get you right!"
Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,"Moroccanoil moisture repair shampoo is formulated with argan oil, which is believed to nourish and moisturize hair, making it suitable for those with dry, damaged, or color-treated hair. I had positive experiences with this shampoo, noting that it leaves my hair feeling softer, smoother, and more manageable. And I like the scent it leaves on my hair"
Moroccanoil Moisture Repair Shampoo,5 / 5,"How many shampoos have been tried (on the shelf in my bathroom there were such brands as Macadamia, Kerastase of different series, Redken, Joico, Sebastian, and other, more budgetary brands), all were good in some ways, let down in some ways, but none of them hooked so that I would not want to try something else. Shampoo for restoration and moisturizing. Bribed in it that you can moisturize and restore hair with one tool. Bottle 250 ml. The price is stunning, but it was on it that my hair opted.The bottle is rubberized to the touch, so it does not slip in wet hands. Interestingly, there is no label on the bottle, all the text is printed directly on it. The shampoo itself is a beautiful pearly color, thick, but lathers very well, which makes it quite economical. The scent... divine. He seems to be sweetish, but at the same time some kind of weightless, not intrusive. For 1.5 years, I didn’t get tired of the fragrance, but only fall in love with it more. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he does not stay on the hair and does not obsessively pursue the whole day.The shampoo gives a soft gentle foam, rinses the hair well and does not confuse them. After using the shampoo, the hair becomes more manageable, and for my striving for frizzy hair, this is important - for me, this is confirmation of the moisturizing effect of the shampoo. As for restoration, it’s unlikely, I don’t believe that it can be restored, but what protects the hair is yes, they become more resilient and more easily tolerate any impact.With this shampoo, the paint does not wash out of the hair for much longer (even ammonia-free, even tinting agents), and its shade acquires a beautiful shine.Plus, the hair is soft and, it seems to me, grows quickly. Overall, this shampoo is the best thing that ever happened to my hair! I recommend!"

Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,4 / 5,I like the suave shampoo it makes your hair smell good and makes your hair not so frizzed out and it is inexpensive it gives your hair such good texture for the price suave has always been in my shower sense I was young lol
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,I have used this plenty of times growing up. It does get the job done of removing certain build up in my hair. But since I have curly hair it does strip it from certain oils. But the conditioner rejuvenates and replaces the stripped oils.
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner I love the smell and it makes my hair super smooth and shiny.

Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,4 / 5,"definitely made my hair thicker. it left it smooth, and untangled. i would definitely recommend if your looking for a cheaper good quality shampoo. it did sorta make my hair get more greasy than normal but that could definitely be different for everyone."
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,4 / 5,This product is okay. But just okay. Not that exciting. It gets the job done. I wouldn't say it would make someone's hair straight if they have curly hair. Definitely doesn't do that. It lathers up very well and it cleans like any other shampoo to me. I was satisfied. But just don't think it's going to straighten out your hair with one shampoo or even 100 shampoos in a row. The only thing it might do is make it a little easier to comb through when you get out of the shower and a little bit smoother when you flat iron it. Just try it for yourself. Products react to everyone's hair and skin type differently. Good luck! It is definitely worth giving a try.
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,I brought this shampoo along with its conditioner from Walmart. It cleanses the hair very well and it leaves moisture without being too oily or sticky. It has soft nice fragrance. I would highly recommend this shampoo.

Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love it suave shampoo because they let your hair really good to soft, leaves the hair super manageable ready to style I use the shampoo and conditioner"
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,I do not know why this product is not as popular as it should be! It’s literally less than $5 and it works better than high end shampoos in my opinion!

Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,This product is awesome!! This is my go to shampoo and conditioner. Smells amazing and leaves your hair so soft.

I have very dry course wavy hair and it does a excellent job very impressive will repurchase again."
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,4 / 5,"I actually wanted to give this five stars. The only reason I didn't is because I know that I need to be using a shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate free. Besides that, I love this shampoo. I love the way it smells, I love that I barely have to use any to get the desired lather I need for my hair (medium length). And I love that my hair looks very shiny, is easy to manage, and my frizz is under control."
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,2 / 5,It has been over 5 years since I used this shampoo . What I do remember is very dry hair that was unmanageable when I let my hair air dry.
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this great salon style product. Great price point, leaves hair feeling great. This is a staple in my bathroom for sure."
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,I love the smell but my hairs baby fine and very prone to static this helps with that but it weighs my hair down and to me makes it feel alittle oily. My hair is also very straight so i need no help with keeping straight so when it weighs hair it straightens it but with oily feel.

Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,I’ve been using this shampoo since I bleached my hair a few years ago and it’s made my hair super soft and helps my curls form. I recommend using the conditioner that goes with this because it makes it so much better.
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,This smooth and sleek works as well as pricier brands to me! &nbsp;I like to use it with the smooth and sleek conditioner as well. &nbsp;It helps to tame frizz in my hair and leave my hair silky.&nbsp;
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,"I liked the way this shampoo made my hair feel, it was a little like the daily clarifying shampoos. It leathers up really well."
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,This did not work as I expected. It was a good product for dry scalps. But it was pretty pricey.
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,My hair was clean and it smells super good but it's one of thoSe where my hair begin getting oily already by morning time so it's not super good for oily prone hair but it's good for hair that is damaged

Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,3 / 5,"Suave is an excellent bargain brand, but sadly I will never be able to rate them as highly as I could because all of their shampoos contain SLS. Many of the Suave Professionals lines are near dupes for salon brands (which also tend to have SLS) but they do not cooperate well with my thick, coarse, frizzy/wavy hair."
Suave Sleek & Smooth Shampoo,5 / 5,Love this shampoo! Makes your hair feel so soft and clean! No other shampoo compares to this! I would recommend dropping the price a little.

Garnier Damage Repairing Treat Shampoo + Papaya Extract,3 / 5,"Werbung 💙 💚 ✔️ danke an @gofeminin_testlabor und @garnierdeutschland für das Testen der neuen Fructis Serie Papaya. Zu testen ist die Spülung, das Shampoo und die 3 in 1 Maske. Mein Mann dachte das es Orangensaft ist und wollte es fast trinken, da besteht echt Verwechslungsgefahr wenn man nicht genau hin schaut 😂 Zum Produkt selbst: das Shampoo riecht sehr angenehm fruchtig nach Papaya. Die Konsistenz ist sehr dickflüssig, es schäumt etwas, meiner Meinung nach zu wenig. Es hinterlässt auch keinen Geruch auf den Haaren was mich sehr wundert. Der Deckel lässt sich einfach abschrauben - eine gute Gelegenheit auch Nachfüller anzubieten. In Kombination mit der 3in1 Maske ein tolles Produkt, um die Haare gesünder werden zu lassen und Spliss zu reduzieren. Die Verpackung kann wiederverwendet werden was ich super finde."

Even on days where the weather is hot and humid (i live in Florida) my naturally frizzy hair will stay smooth and under control all day. I also use this as my heat protection when straightening and curling my hair. If i need more product, i’m not afraid to use more because it doesn’t make my hair super greasy- just controls my frizz and gives me the shine i’m looking for.

Il liscio perdura ed i capelli profumano!

Garnier Smoothing Oil with Coconut Oil & Cocoa Butter Extracts,5 / 5,Hair oil is well known for locking in moisture or helping tame fly aways. I really like this for reducing the frizz but I also think it smells amazing and doesn't leave the hair looking wet or feeling greasy. I really rate this

This helps to keep it smooth and feel more moisturized. I like to use it on my ends after wash days and before styling. I use this before wash days in a small amount throughout my whole head mixed with a deep conditioner! ❤️"
Garnier Smoothing Oil with Coconut Oil & Cocoa Butter Extracts,3 / 5,"My hair was just not impressed with this product. I have natural fine slightly wavy hair. While I did really enjoy the scent of this product it seemed no matter the amount I used on my hair it would just turn me into a grease ball. I ended up trying to simply use it on my roots and that works okay, but there really doesn't seem to be any benefits from this product. The scent reminds me of a classic coconut summertime smell. I wish the product worked better for me. It's something I definitely do not plan to buy again. As it is it's going to last forever just using it on the ends of my hair. Some with really dry hair and issues with frizz and flyaways would probably enjoy this."
Garnier Smoothing Oil with Coconut Oil & Cocoa Butter Extracts,5 / 5,"A wonderful product in every way that saved my hair - thanks Garnier! The oil is saturated with many useful and natural ingredients, it is based on 2 powerful ""reducing agents"" at once - coconut oil and cocoa butter.

Garnier Smoothing Oil with Coconut Oil & Cocoa Butter Extracts,5 / 5,"Garnier Smoothing Oil with Coconut Oil & Cocoa Butter Extracts This product retails for $6.47 each on Walmart's website. This product came to my hand by mere accident because it was in the things that my late mother used to own. My mother passed away on October 6th of 2021 and these were her holy grail products I guess I can call them 🤗. It's a smoothing oil made with Coconut oil and Cocoa Butter extract, it's a luxurious oil that deeply smoothes and helps eliminate the frizz and flyaways. My hair tends to be on the frizzy side and I have noticed my hair being smooth and manageable after starting to use this product, mind you I only had a very tiny amount left because like I said this product used to belong to my mom there was only a little bit of product left enough for me to experience it for at least a week and now I'm so hooked that I have to replace it with a brand new bottle!!. I never knew that Garnier hair had smoothing oils for hair and I love Garnier hair products. I don't know how I missed it! 🙋🤦"

Garnier Smoothing Oil with Coconut Oil & Cocoa Butter Extracts,2 / 5,"this did not do anything for my natural hair. if you have curly/wavy hair looking for something to smooth your natural frizz out, skip this one. the only reason it has 2 stars is because 1, it does smell really really good, and 2, i use this as a little shine for whenever i straighten my hair. but other than that, i would pass!"

Garnier Hydrating Treat Shampoo + Aloe Extract,4 / 5,[product:garnier-hydrating-treat-shampoo-aloe-extract-88] Bought at my local drugsore. I cant lie it is actually nice for a drugstore shampoo\cond but not for people with fine or thin hair which I have. My hair felt soft but my roots had a oily residue and I washed shampooed twice.

Herbal Essences Bio:Renew Sheer Moisture Cucumber & Green Tea Shampoo - 13.5 fl oz,5 / 5,"Last winter I was using this combo to protect my hair.. Your hair is damaged as it absorbs impurities throughout the day.This renew's natural antioxidants remove impurities to protect your hair from damage.BThe real botanicals in this formula have been endorsed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. **My Review** Absolutely love this conditioner and matching shampoo. It worked to detangle my hair and helped give it a shine without it being heavy on my hair. My hair is now softer and healthy looking. It also doesn’t leave a waxy build up like other conditioners do, thanks to it being paraben free. It has a lively clean smell. It smells so good and lasts a day or two. I've even had people compliment me on my hair smelling good. The coolness of the cucumber is calming and the tea tree is medicating."
TRESemmé Pro Pure Damage Shampoo,4 / 5,"I’ve been on the hunt for a shampoo that doesn’t just clean my hair but actually helps repair it, so I decided to give the TRESemmé Pro Pure Damage Shampoo a try—and I’m genuinely impressed! First off, it’s sulfate-free and free from any unnecessary dyes and parabens, which is a big plus for me. I’m trying to use gentler products, especially since I color and style my hair pretty often. One thing that really drew me to this shampoo is that it’s infused with the goodness of fermented rice water. This ingredient is amazing because it gives hair a much-needed protein boost, which helps repair and strengthen strands, making them look healthier. Fermented rice water is rich in amino acids and Vitamin E—two powerhouse ingredients. The amino acids act like building blocks, helping to repair damage and improve elasticity, so my hair feels softer and less prone to breakage. Vitamin E, on the other hand, brings antioxidant benefits, which helps protect my hair from environmental damage while keeping it shiny and smooth. After a few washes, I noticed my hair felt softer and looked a lot less dry, especially at the ends. It lathers up nicely even without sulfates, which is great because I love that clean feeling, but it never feels like it’s stripping my hair of moisture. My hair also seems smoother and less frizzy, which makes styling easier. The scent is subtle but fresh, which I appreciate since I’m not big on overpowering fragrances. And even though it’s more of a ‘clean’ formula, it still leaves my hair feeling super refreshed. Overall, if you’re dealing with damage from heat or color treatments like me, this shampoo is a solid choice! I think it’s going to be a new staple in my hair care routine."

TRESemmé Pro Pure Damage Shampoo,5 / 5,This product is ok for damage hair I have used it in the pass and it really help with my hair.
TRESemmé Pro Pure Damage Shampoo,4 / 5,"I purchased this shampoo earlier on this month at my local Cub foods nearby and used it for the first time last night, and then again tonight. On the whole I think it is a good quality shampoo product and I like that the ingredients are clean and do not include harsh ones like parabens. The consistency to me seems lightly gellike more or less and it distributes into my hair easily. It is gentle and the scent to me seems light and pleasant. Unfortunately the first time I used this product last night, I did notice that I did not find it to wash/rinse out adequately in my hair, in the sense that some residue (oils from my hair previously, not necessarily the product itself) was actually still left on my hair when using the product alone. My hair is on the thinner/finer side, often oily in the roots to mid areas, and drier as well as more probe to breakage towards the tips/ends. I found that when I combined this in a mixture with a more clarifying shampoo (the one I used was a citrus scented one I have from Wild Harvest) it worked quite well for my hair, though. Tonight, I used it *after* using another dose of my pink colored 3 in 1 shampoo/conditioning product (which is a treatment you leave in for just a little bit), it worked just about perfectly, though. It is a reasonably good product at a good price point, but it is hard to say with any certainty how is would react with your hair type. I only know that I liked it overall but felt it needed to be combined with another product in order to work effectively for me. I have now attached some pictures for reference about how is worked for my hair. Also using [product:pacifica-beauty-sea-purify-balancing-clay-mask] at the moment."
TRESemmé Pro Pure Damage Shampoo,5 / 5,I really like and recommend Tresemme pro pure damage shampoo and conditioner because I have very thick hair and it works really well for me

We used it together with its conditioner from the same range.Also loved the see through 100% recyclable bottle in 380ml which is great value. [product:tresemme-pro-pure-damage-shampoo] Good on TRESemmé to aiming high for the best and to protect their customers. Will surely continue using and highly recommend to others. :)"
TRESemmé Pro Pure Damage Shampoo,4 / 5,"Its my first shampoo i did tried from TRESemme pure range, i loved the idea that it is sulfate and paraben free which is important for the best health of the hair. The bottle itself looks definitely attractive (gives clean impression straight away) and modern. When I opened the bottle I felt pleasant combination of floral and coconut notes. Whilst using I seen that shampoo has a good lather and easy to use, I have thick hair personally so i didn't need much product as with some of different brands. After washing, the hair feels moisture and more shinier and I did have a clean hair and scalp feeling. It didn't make my hair even more dry or damaged. After blow try, I did enjoy how smooth my hair was and it look much healthier. Although, few more washes improved my damaged hair, which didn't look healthy due to usage of bleach. I would recommend to give a go for this shampoo as it paraben and sulfate free product, so you won't overload you hair with additional chemicals but will improve the texture and balance of the hair. During the usage I didnt feel any side effects or signs of irritation, so It could be used by sensitive skin consumers."

Ogx Beauty Brazilian Keratin Therapy Salon Size Shampoo (25.4 oz),2 / 5,I like this product but I don’t like the ingredients.

This shampoo helped me a lot and kept my hair looking really straight. I used this shampoo for at least a year (with the conditioner and the spray) and it kept my hair looking shiny and healthy.

My hair also had been coming out in the shower for the past few months even though I was gently washing my hair and used products that had no harsh stripping things in it. This shampoo along with the conditioner are fantastically amazing! I have noticed 5 strands or less at times coming out and my hair feels and looks softer and healthier overall. Less tangles! The scent isn't heavy nor fake smelling, I enjoy the scent actually. Yes this is a little bit pricier but I recommend this for anyone and everyone, especially for girls/ women that are mixed with African- American (my daughter is, i purchased something that works so well with her hair, but this stuff does too!)"

La textura del acondicionador es más opaca y espesa, y también basta con un poco y su aroma tiene una leve nota cítrica, más refrescante entre tanto dulce. Debo reconocer que mi pelo ha quedado realmente exquisito, muy suave, liviano, liso, sin frizz (y eso que aún estoy usando secador), con un aroma muy rico, y además se ve muy brillante y hasta las puntas se sienten suavecitas.

Oribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Shampoo,5 / 5,"I recently tried the Oribe Shampoo and Conditioner, and they completely elevated my hair care routine! From the luxurious packaging to the noticeable results, this duo is a standout in premium hair care. Shampoo: The Oribe Shampoo has a rich, creamy texture that lathers beautifully without feeling heavy or stripping. It left my hair feeling incredibly clean but still soft and hydrated, which is a tough balance to achieve. I also noticed that it didn’t weigh down my hair, making it feel light and bouncy. The signature scent is divine—sophisticated but not overpowering—and lingers subtly throughout the day. Conditioner: The Oribe Conditioner complements the shampoo perfectly, offering deep hydration without making my hair feel greasy or limp. My hair feels silky and smooth after each use, and it’s much easier to detangle. It also helped tame my frizz and added a beautiful shine to my hair, making it look healthier overall. After consistent use, I’ve noticed that my hair feels stronger, more manageable, and less prone to breakage. Though Oribe products are on the pricier side, I definitely feel the investment is worth it for the salon-quality results and the luxurious experience."

I have 4c African American hair that I regularly blow out with a Brazilian keratin treatment. My hair can be very dry and sometimes sheds quite a bit, but I think my shedding reduced during the time I was using this product.

Oribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Shampoo,3 / 5,"I'm not usually really picky about what I use on my hair but I wouldn't reach for this even if it was free (which it was for me).

Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,5 / 5,The Biolage line is by far the best line that ive used. I've got very curly hair and it tends to get very dry and very frizzy. I can't use most shampoos because they dry my hair out even more but this one left my hair feeling softer and quenched! I felt like I just got it washed at a salon and the conditioner is great too. It is a little more expensive but so worth it for your hair
Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,5 / 5,I’ve been using biolage for years now and always love it.. nothing can compare to the smell and it is also good for your hair
Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,4 / 5,I love the smell of this hair care line and I think they have alright ingredients but i didn’t notice a major difference in the amount of frizz that I experienced. One thing I did like was the shampoo was not too sudsy meaning it was light in sulfur
Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo is one of the only shampoos in the drug store you can find that is good for your hair. The cheaper options have harsh ingredients that can strip your natural oils from your scalp. I’m not really sure if it smoothing my hair as it’s advertised, but it smells great and lathers well."

Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,3 / 5,Bring a bit of a product snob I’m always hesitant to try a new product. My stylist asked me to try this as I have a real problem with frizz.

Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,5 / 5,I love you send this set up shampoo and conditioner because it leaves your hair so smooth and soft and smelling so good

Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have frizzy hair...I blame it on the one perm I got in middle school in the 90's. I've tried every brand and product to fix it but have never had any luck. This is the closest shampoo that I have found that leaves my hair so silky soft, less fly-aways, and is never greasy. It doesn't weigh my hair down and gives it great volume. It also smells great which is an added plus!"
Biolage SmoothProof Shampoo,5 / 5,I really like this shampoo. There has been a noticeable decrease in the amount of frizz in my hair and it smells great

Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Smoothing Shampoo with Avocado Oil,2 / 5,Although it smells good [product:pantene-pro-v-nature-fusion-smoothing-shampoo-with-avocado-oil] and the after math straight after washing your hair is amazing and volumising the product is very damaging to the hair in the long run.

Garnier Smoothing Treat Shampoo + Avocado Extract,5 / 5,"It’s nice to see drugstore products become “cleaner”. (Especially at affordable prices so everyone can benefit. ) I bought this because my other shampoo was empty and decided to try it out. The ingredient breakdown they do at the side of the bottle is really informative and I wish a lot more companies would do this! This product is rated at a 2 on EWG. It’s currently summer where I live, so the humidity makes my hair frizz. I did notice it was a lot smoother after using this. (I also did pair it with the conditioner so that helps too. ) It smells great and lathers well. I’ve rarely purchased from Garnier but I would buy this again.

Lo que más llamó mi atención para probarlo es que decía que no tiene siliconas ni parabenos además que es una fórmula vegana, tiene un olor delicioso, nada fuerte y tiene una consistencia cremosita. Me gustó mucho, desde la primer aplicación se siente mas hidratado y con menos friz, ahora compraré toda la línea de Hair food Aguacate por que a mi cabello le cayó super bien. La presentación también me gustó bastante, el botecito se ve como si fuera algo muy muy natural y lo es ya que el 98% de sus ingredientes son de origen natural. Super recomendado."

Garnier Fructis Fall Fight Shampoo,3 / 5,"Garnier Fructis Fall Fight: I love trying different shampoos, to find the best one for me, so this has been one of my liking. My hair loss is not usually excessive but nobody wants to lose hair, that is why I decided to try it and I liked it a lot. In most cases, although it is not ideal, I choose my products for their aroma and this was one of the winners, it smells delicious and I loved its effect in the first months of use on my hair, I really did not notice if it reduced or not the hair loss but it set me fine. I can't use it without conditioner because although my hair is not very dry by itself it did not leave it sufficiently moisturized and with time of use my scalp felt oily and heavy. I would use it again but for a short time and mostly because of its delicious smell. Another point in favor not only of this product but of the entire brand is the attractive presentation of the packaging."

Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,3 / 5,I’ve been using this shampoo to help with my dry scalp which has led to some dandruff. I love this brand Biolage but not super impressed this specific formula and its effectiveness. The zinc does seem to help a little but I honestly think something that treats the scalp like rosemary probably works better. I’m using this until it runs out then switching to something different!
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,Love this silky smooth shampoo. Makes me feel like I'm at a salon. This is by far my favorite shampoo I have used so far. I just wish price was less. But you have to pay for good quality.

Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,Amazing products. It made my hair feel like salon quality at a fraction of the cost. Also very lightweight and has a light scent which is perfect for my sensitive nose. Packaging is great and simple. Another great factor the ingredients are clean.
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,"Biolage Shampoo and Conditioner offer a refreshing and invigorating experience with their delightful scent that lingers throughout the day. The fragrance is a harmonious blend of botanical notes, leaving your hair smelling fresh and clean. Designed for a variety of hair types, this shampoo is particularly effective for normal to oily hair, providing a thorough cleanse without over-drying. The lightweight formula helps maintain hair's natural moisture balance, promoting a healthy scalp and preventing excessive oiliness. One notable pro is the shampoo's ability to enhance hair texture, leaving it noticeably smoother and more manageable. The conditioner complements this effect, adding a touch of softness without weighing the hair down. However, some users with extremely dry or damaged hair may find the moisture level insufficient. Additionally, while the scent is appealing, it might be too strong for those sensitive to fragrances. Overall, Biolage Shampoo and Conditioner deliver a satisfying experience, particularly for individuals seeking a revitalizing and cleansing option for normal to oily hair."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have baby fine hair that is easily weighed down. I love this shampoo. It gives my hair life. The scent is so light and pleasant, yet long lasting. I love the way it makes my hair smell. I buy the big bottles when ULTA has their jumbo sales to get the best bang for my buck. I also find higher quality products like this work better…a little goes a long way compared to the drugstore brands I do sometimes use."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,1 / 5,"Definitely not a product for me. Writing my review to warn others. When I started using this shampoo and conditioner, I experienced hair loss. At first, I did not link it to the shampoo and conditioner. While experiencing more hair loss, I decided to stop using it. I actually gave it away to my mom who I just told that the shampoo and conditioner is not for me, she tells me that after the first use, her hair started falling out like crazy and continued to fall out the next day!!! At first, I thought it was a coincidence that I just changed my shampoo and conditioner and started to expierience hair loss, figured maybe it's not for me but once my mom confirmed the same thing, I wanted to warn others and to look out for this if you're going to try it."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,"The scent is amazing, it left my hair feeling fabulous and very full. Not only is it great value for money but actually left my hair light clean and fresh. I love this!"
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,"I love this shampoo. I’ve tried others, but always find myself going back to this one. I have fine hair naturally, but wear 20” hand-tied extensions most of the time. With or without my hair extensions, I still use this shampoo. I feel like it gives me the volume I want and still manageable. When Ulta has their liter sale, I always buy this shampoo with the conditioner. I’ve tried higher-end, most expensive shampoos that are suppose to help with volume, but none have compared to this one, at least not yet."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,"This is my absolute favorite shampoo! I’ve tried many others, even shampoos that were upwards of $100 and this one is by far my favorite. It is very light and adds a ton of volume to the hair! ￼"
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,"Right from the first wash, I noticed a remarkable difference in my hair. It felt incredibly light and bouncy, with a noticeable boost in volume. The shampoo’s formula is gentle yet effective, as it cleansed my scalp thoroughly without drying it out. The refreshing fragrance was an added bonus that made the shower experience even more enjoyable. What I appreciate most about this shampoo is its ability to provide long-lasting volume. Even after a full day of running errands, my hair retained its body and remained full of life. It also helped to manage frizz and gave my hair a silky smooth texture that I couldn’t help but run my fingers through. I also want to highlight the sustainability aspect of the product. Biolage Volume Bloom Shampoo is paraben-free, which aligns with my commitment to using more natural and eco-friendly hair care products. This makes me feel good about not only the results but also their impact on the environment.love love love it"
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo lathers really well and is lightweight, my hair always feels sleek and clean after using it and I haven’t had any problems with dryness either which I feel like is common in volumizing shampoos. It works well with the hydrating conditioner for thin hair."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,Love the smell. Not sure if it’s helped with volume because my hair is so fine and blonde but the smell is great and doesn’t overwhelm me. They use similar stuff in the salons and makes me feel like I’m at the salon
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,"I was given a travel size (1.7 oz) sample of this shampoo and conditioner from Salon Centric. Rather than take my big bottles on vacay of what I typically use, I decided to pack these to save space. I do not have fine hair; my hair is very coarse and thick. Because of this I didn’t have high hopes that this particular formula would work well in my hair. This shampoo was actually much better than I expected. It smells amazing, did a great job cleansing my hair, and did not weigh it down. Since I have a lot of hair, I didn’t think a voluminizing shampoo would help my hair. I have used products from this line for many years and they are excellent quality."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,I got a small size of this just to try out when there was a sale happening and I fell in love. I always double shampoo and this did not dry my hair out and left it silky soft with lots of volume. Smells like candy too.

Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,5 / 5,"I struggle with finding a shampoo that actually helps to control my grease, and it does give amazing volume as also promised haha. I really appreciate finally being able to go more than a day without washing my hair now!"
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,3 / 5,"I have very thin, fine hair and have struggled finding a shampoo to give me what I’m looking for. Biolage has definitely kept my hair health and is continuing to make it appear more full, however it is heavy and doesn’t lather very well in small amount so more is needed in order to get full coverage."

Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,2 / 5,"This shampoo did nothing for my fine thin hair. It actually made it feel heavier and not weightless, and was so difficult to comb through my hair when combined with the matching conditioner and leave in spray. I tried it with other conditioner too and same result, very tangled hair. Not happy!"
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,3 / 5,It didn't give me any kind of volume in my hair. I honestly believe that Pantene volumizing shampoo is better than this shampoo

Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,"I love how my fine limp hair felt after the first use. Obviously my hair is still fine after using but it does have lots of volume so doesn't look as limp! Does it make it grow? Well, I honestly can't say if it does or doesn't since my hair grows fast anyways. But I do like the clean feel I get after using and I can also go several days between washing without it looking limp or oily."
Biolage VolumeBloom Shampoo,4 / 5,"This a good “every day” shampoo. I bought it in the liter size and will obviously use it.. it isn’t my absolute favorite, but it gets my hair clean and that’s what matters!! 🤪 Tip: shampoo your hair twice if you go longer than a day or two between washes.. or if you use a lot of styling products! You’ll thank me later 😉"

Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,2 / 5,It has some really good ingredients but then puts fragrance as like the third one. Way too potent of a smell. I was honestly really excited for this and ended up not liking it all. Leaves hair with a weird waxy feeling and looks dull. Makes hair feel a little bit thicker which is the only pro. Overall not really a fan of how it made my hair feel or look.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,The smell is a little overwhelming. But.... It works! It works without drying your hair out or making it frizzy. I definitely recommend this product if you have thin hair!
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,2 / 5,"I was so excited to receive this via a VoxBox but my first use of the product ended up also being my last. First off, I loved the concept of the product! It advertises intelligent haircare using biotin, caffeine, niacinamide, amino acids, and rice protein. So what’s the problem? The fragrance. I was so shocked by how strong it was! If you look at the ingredient list you will find that it’s quite high up on the list. I am personally not a fan of the scent. It’s a masculine, musky smell. Typically, I avoid scented skin care products, but I am a sucker for good smelling hair care products because it enhances my showering experience. The fragrance in this case did not. My partner (male) was also not a fan. He actually asked me if I could re-wash my hair with another shampoo. I am bummed because I would like to continue to use it to see if it works as advertised , but I really can’t stand the smell. If you have a sensitive nose, this is not the product for you."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,2 / 5,"I would like to state first what i like in this shampoo. I like the packaging, it’s luxurious style and that’s all. This shampoo is not for me. Though it says that it’s a thickening shampoo. At first use i noticed that my hair have a lot of fall off, unlike when I use my regular shampoo. The scent is too strong for me, it smells like a men’s perfume. It doesn’t lather well. I need to do a second wash to have that good lather. I will give it to my husband, maybe he will like it. But i will not use it again."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,"I got this shampoo for free in exchange for my honest review. I have mixed feelings about this shampoo. I’ll finish the bottle I was sent, but for now, I’m not sure if I’ll buy another bottle. Especially because I feel like I have to use more of it than other shampoos to get my hair clean. Pro: I like strong scents and it was STRONG, it didn’t make my scalp feel overly greasy or overly dry, my curls seemed to like the formula, and it washed out easily. Con: it doesn’t lather easily, I didn’t notice any “thickening” benefits over any other shampoo I use, and the scent itself is more masculine (still not sure if that’s completely a con but with it being as strong as it is and it lingering throughout the day, I’d prefer to have a scent I know I love)."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,"I like the smell of this shampoo a lot. I did feel like I had to shampoo twice to get a good lather, which isn’t typical for me, but it did do its job without making my hair feel dried out"
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo though very strongly scented, really clarified my hair thoroughly. I usually shampoo twice when I wash my hair to deep clean any residue of hair products. This shampoo left my hair squeaky clean without drying out my ends!"
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I did receive my products from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I will start off with how much I love the smell of these products. This shampoo lathers well, rinses easily and doesn't leave any residue. It leaves the hair soft and smelling great on its own, but is even better when paired with other products from the line. My other favorites were the conditioner and hair serum."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I really love this product when I wash my hair I feel like I’m detoxifying it and it smells great￼. I never knew about these products before receiving the samples, but I’m extremely happy to be introduced as this is a new go to in my hair routine!"
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,I received this product from Influester and Grow Gorgeous in exchange for my honest review. This was also a meh for me. It wasn’t thickening my hair nor it also remove any build ups. I still had to use my regular shampoo afterwards
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I was very pleased with this shampoo how it gently cleansed my hair leaving it healthier and stronger. The shampoo did not overdry or strip my hair, instead I felt it become nourished and thicker with each use. I love that the ingredients are vegan and cruelty free. The combination of the Grow Gorgeous Instense shampoo and conditioner contain key elements to naturally nourish the hair while leaving a pleasant scent. My hair feels stronger without being dried out. Overall I am very thrilled so far with the results I am seeing."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,When I first opened the bottle I was hit with a strong scent so I was worried how it would be with my scalp. Luckily it didn't irritate my scalp and I got used to the scent right away. Now I feel like my hair is actually clean! I haven't seen a difference in hair thickening tho. Sadly it was only a sample size. I did get 2 sample sizes of this shampoo
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,1 / 5,"Sorry to say that I couldn’t test this product too much, tried to give it many chances but the smell is too strong for my taste. I’m an avid fragrance user and the smell of the shampoo and conditioner was outshining any of it. Had to give it to my sister’s boyfriend."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,This shampoo did what it was supposed to do. It cleaned well without being stripping. It had a nice lather. Actually removed the ton of product put into my hair every week. I absolutely loved the scent. I don’t think it made much of a difference in thickening my hair tho.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,I was pleasantly surprised to see niacinamide listed as a main ingredient. It works wonders for my skin so I was excited to try it on my scalp and I’ve liked the results so far. It’s a little heavy because I have such thin fine hair but hopefully that will continue to improve as my hair thickens.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,I liked the combo of this brands shampoo and conditioner. Leaves hair soft and clean. Not sure why they sent a sample of the shampoo and a full size conditioner. Would have liked to test out the combination longer. But overall I would recommend.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,"I really enjoyed using this shampoo as I instantly fell in love with the scent! I've not used it long enough to be able to tell if my hair is actually thicker or not but my hair feels ""revived"" and looks like it did when I was younger in my teens! Would absolutely recommend."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,"My hair feels a little thicker, but anything feels thicker since my hair is pretty thin to begin with! I did like the smell though, but I can see how it could be a bit heavy for people. Was a little confused on the smaller bottle, but it was alright."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I like the smell, I get of tiny of shampoo and do I massaging to my scalp through the ends line 5 minutes and then I apply my a conditioner I both work very good on my hair. I love this brand. It the best."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,When I used this with my thickening conditioner and the mask I noticed that my hair felt and looked a bit thicker. I was expecting a lot more but I do think it's because I don't wash my hair every single day. I feel like this product will work more with more usage.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,"This shampoo, together with the entire line that they sent me to try for free, has made me fall in love with the results that it has given to my hair for a month of constant use. I can say that it has been one of the best hair products that I have tried since I am pregnant and my hair was falling out too much in two weeks it stopped the fall and I can say that my dry hair damaged by the dyes looks and feels softer and shinier so I can only tell you that the aroma is the only thing that I do not I'm done liking if I wouldn't have 5 stars"
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,2 / 5,"I actually liked the more neutral scent of this and was hoping it’d work out for me but honestly it left my hair pretty dry. I was willing to try it out a fe more times but once I got out of the shower, the scent was way too overpowering. Like my family in the living room smelled my hair before seeing me kind of overpowering. I just couldn’t handle it and had to wash my hair again with something else."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,I am not very fond of the scent of this shampoo it smells kinda manly to me. But i actually like the results I am seeing with using this line of products. I have long fine hair and I am starting to see and feel some thickness in my hair. I will continue to use this brand of products
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,"The feel of this shampoo is nice, but I feel like i have to use a double amount of this compared to other shampoos. The scent is also too strong, and I don't usually mind scented products but this one is a bit too powerful."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,This has been one of the better free of(you name it) shampoo I have tried. It did a great job at breaking through natural oils and dry shampoo all while being gentle. I was overall very impressed with what this shampoo achieved!
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,On the plus side it does leave my hair feeling clean but it doesn’t lather very well so I feel like I need more product for it to do its job. It makes my hair feel a bit dry. Works well if paired with the conditioner. I enjoy the woodsy scent it has. Not my favorite shampoo though.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I know most people have said they don’t like the smell but I actually really enjoy it. It does have a more “masculine” smell to it, for me it isn’t overwhelming at all. It had a light suds not anything that could be drying."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"Grow Gorgeous volumizing shampoo is much better unlike other volumizing shampoo products. . It does not thin out the hair completely. I have fine hair and after using this shampoo my hair felt bouncy, lightweight and shiny. It smells amazing and the best part is doesn’t make my hair feel rough yet provides volume. I totally love the Grow Gorgeous products and this is perfect for my thin hair. I would highly recommend it."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have tried the series of the set of the product: shampoo, conditioner, mask and serum. My hair condition is much better than before. I will definitely continue using shampoo and conditioner as the products are great; price range fits my budget. However the smell is stronger than others product I used"
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,Love the smell of this Shampoo. It definitely makes my hair look more healthy as well as shiny. My hair lso feels very soft after using thiswhich I love.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I really liked this shampoo from Grow Gorgeous. I felt it cleaned my hair really good, without stripping too much moisture, nor not cleaning enough. This shampoo got nice and sudsy and left my hair feeling clean and more volumized than a standard shampoo. I know most people didn't like the scent, but I enjoyed the scent of the product, while it is a bit strong, it smells very pleasant and lingers in the hair once it's dry. I felt my hair felt softer and was more healthy looking as well (paired with the same conditioner)."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,I love this entire set!!! It smells amazing. It is one of the best hair sets that I have ever used and I have used many ( I am a reformed product junkie). I love this shampoo. It has a great lather. It left my curls squeaky clean.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,"I tried this by itself initially and saw some improvements, but once I started using it with the conditioner I saw amazing results in the volume and thickness of my hair. I went from having extremely baby fine hair, to hair that I could start to curl, where the curls would actually stay all day.￼ I would definitely recommend this to anybody who suffers from thin or baby fine hair."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,"Every time after using this my hair was really dry at first, The smell is a masculine smell not feminine. Love that I was able to try this kit, I did have less hair fall out using it."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,I am very picky when it comes to hair shampoo. I have oily roots but very dry ends since my hair is so long. I feel like this shampoo doesn’t lather as much as other shampoos I’m used to which I really need in order for my hair to truly feel clean. I’ve been using this in conjunction with the serum so it’s hard to say if it’s this or the serum that has been giving me subtle baby hairs.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,I loved it I always shampoo twice because of how soap works but the second shampoo allowed me to really see how well this shampoo works and cleansing and conditioning
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,The grow gorgeous intense thickening shampoo works well. Definitely cleans and suds up but I do think it could dry hair out if used as the only shampoo in someone's hair care routine
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"The shampoo is the same with the conditioner, i love it! It smells amazing and makes your hair feel so soft and nourished."
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,4 / 5,I absolutely love the smell of this shampoo! It smells like something you'd get in a high end salon. My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to lather as well as my other shampoos. I only got about three washes per each small bottle.
Grow Gorgeous Intense Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"My scalp is really dry(most times because of most shampoos aren’t good for my skin,they have to many chemicals in them. That’s why I read all the ingredients every time🫣). But that cool shampoo(I love the matte package) made the dryness gone,and oh thank you! Now it’s in my favorite list🤍"
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,5 / 5,I use this everyday. It is perfect for my hair. It doesn’t make it greasy or anything. It also smells amazing! I always get compliments. The packaging is also super cute and it has ingredients that are actually good for hair health. I highly recommend
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,5 / 5,"Absolutely love the smell of this! It has helped me with my hair, it doesn't feel as dry, very soft and refreshed. I don't need to use a lot so the value for me is great compared to other products"

Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,4 / 5,At first I was very skeptical about this shampoo because I have tried so many and non have worked but this one was so amazing. It works well and smells amazing.

Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,3 / 5,Il profumo eccezionale di cocco purtroppo non basta a questo shampoo per nutrire e idratare un capello trattato come il mio. Rimane abbastanza solido come consistenza sul cuoio capelluto e ne bisogna usare una grande quantità per avere la sensazione di pulito. Il no siliconi sul mio capello purtroppo fa la differenza. Peccato.
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,1 / 5,this made my hair drier and brittle. i found i couldn’t detangle my hair and it was like straw. this is definitely not for curly hair. i wanted to like it but it damaged my hair
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,5 / 5,"The BEST shampoo that i’ve used that’s out there! i am completely in love with this shampoo. I’ve tried a few other shampoos from this line but this one is by far the best. i have super dry hair (especially in winter) and when i use this shampoo—my hair becomes so soft, silky, and smooth. Almost like hair you see in shampoo commercials! in the past, i’ve tried other shampoos from the Maui line and they were nice but didn’t give my the shine/healthy looking hair i was looking for. the scent of this one is AMAZING, but to over powering with the coconut smell. I usually purchase the product at target, the price is reasonable compared to other ones on the market. I’d have to say that one of my FAV things about this line is it is CLEAN! Free from dyes, sulfates, silicones, and all that other junk you don’t want on your hair. This stuff is great and will continue to purchase for years to come"
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,5 / 5,"It smells so good and feels great on my hair. It makes it soft and feel clean. The packaging itself is okay, I mean I don't really have any complaints. For what you get in that bottle it's a really good price."

Additionally, it offers great value for the price."
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,5 / 5,"i can’t even explain how much i love this shampoo!!! i’ve found that some shampoos eventually weigh down my hair, but i’ve been using this for 2 years, and it never has!! the packaging is aesthetic, but it is also effective and smells like coconuts!!!"

Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,4 / 5,"I want to *love* Maui Nourish and Moisture, but it's not quite the bomb for me. I love the cute bottle, the affordable price, the widespread availability. the mellow pleasant scent, and especially that it is *silicone free.* Don't get me wrong, I like it ALOT, I just am not in LOVE with it! I will definitely try other Maui products! And likely stick with this one as like once a month conditioner. Something about my hair type and/or the total hard water I have, coconut oil doesn't give me *SLIP* to detangle easily. I need to brush my hair out before shower with this one. It does make my hair feel and look good next day and days after, but coconut oil is always slow to absorb into my hair. I'm thinking this is a once a month thing for me:):):)"
Maui Moisture Nourish & Moisture + Coconut Milk Shampoo,5 / 5,"I’ve been looking for a while for some shampoo and conditioners that were more natural and wouldn’t irritate my scalp. Well! When I came across these I was so happy, they have no silicones, no mineral oil, no sulfated surfactants are vegan and made with 100% Aloe Vera as the first ingredient.

L'Oreal Paris Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo,3 / 5,"I have really fine, straight hair. It tangles with any movement and is difficult to style and keep the style. I have been noticing all these ""thickening"" shampoos and conditioners coming out on the market and was curious as to how they can make my fine hair look and feel thicker with more body. I'm in the shower, got my hair wet and ready to shampoo. I'm so excited. What if this really works? I see the L'OREAL Paris Elvive Volume Filler Shampoo has something called Filloxane in it. Hmm.. I've never heard of it but that doesn't mean much. It states that it gives fine, thin hair the grip that it lacks to give me full body, light weight and voluminous hair. The shampoo smells nice and it works into a lather rather well. As I'm rinsing it out, my hair kinda feels course, not soft. My hair isn't going down my back like it usually does when I rinse. That's because it's all tangled up. Hopefully the conditioner will take care of that and make it feel softer too. I find myself needing extra conditioner to feel it through my hair. It doesn't help much so far. Okay. I'm out of the shower and my hair has been up in a towel for about 20 minutes. Time to comb these tangles out. 5 minutes later I'm still on the first side of my hair, trying to detangle without pulling it out. My arms are tired and this feels hopeless. I reach for the leave-in conditioner in a spray. Apply a generous portion of this and a little more time and I have straight hair again. My hair felt like it didn't retain any moisture either. I'm not looking forward to trying this again. And I haven't yet. It's been a couple of weeks. I knew it was too good to be true. I'll never have voluminous hair in this lifetime. Oh well. I can say I tried. Bottom line: Don't expect miracles. I was wondering how they were going to make my hair thicker and I got a head of severely tangled hair that seemed to be stripped of any moisture it had. I won't be buying this again."
L'Oreal Paris Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,I love how this lathers in the shower and feels all sudsy it really cleans my hair and when my hair dries afterwards I have tons of volume and lots of body
L'Oreal Paris Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo,5 / 5,"I'm not sure what filloxane is supposed to be, but it's doing something! This is a good quality shampoo, smells nice, and the lather expands! And of course there's a noticeable difference in my hair, which isn't always the case with purported volumizing products, so a pleasant surprise! I have a couple higher-priced shampoos in my rotation as well, but this is absolutely my go-to for shopping on the cheap."

Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,This is my favorite purple shampoo! My stylist used this once and took the photo of my hair afterwards for her Insta page! My hair is naturally dry because I get highlights/bleach. This purple shampoo does a great job of getting rid of the brassiness and makes my hair so soft and conditioned. I started using the entire Biolage line because of this and haven’t looked back!
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,I like this shampoo a lot since i bleach my hair it’s hard to keep it fresh and blonde. This really helps take all the yellow out of your hair. Only downside which comes with any purple shampoo is how it drys your hair out. That’s why it’s recommended to use one a week along with a hydrating shampoo. Mid range in price but totally worth it.
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,I tried this and it definitely works! Love it! Biolage you always rock! I like the scent too! Tones my brassy blonde down! This product works great.
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"Moisturizing to your hair. Helps maintain the color of your hair and keeps it healthy looking. Purple shampoo is really great for people who recently dyed their hair, especially if you have gone lighter on your hair."

Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,4 / 5,"Smells great, and has a nice thick texture. For the price, it’s worth it if you have brassy hair. After a few uses, I could tell a difference. It smells wonderful also."
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,Such good shampoos with this brand but with this one specifically it worked so well with my blonde hair. People actually kept thinking I just got it colored but only thing I was doing was using this to get those yellow tones out

Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,I love the Biolage brand and the combination of color last and purple shampoo is great for my hair since I switch so fast between colored hair and blonde tones ! It’s also great if you’re a household with multiple dyed haired people!
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,This is the best purple shampoo I have tried. I have tried many different ones and I feel like this one works the best without leaving your hair purple. I have only tried the new Olaplex purple shampoo one time so I don’t have the best ability to compare. The only thing I am able to say as of now is that is think this one leaves the hair more moisturized. I felt like the olaplex kind of stripped my hair of moisture if I was going to continue using it This leaves my hair with moisture and I love the color of blonde I’m left with.
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"I always use purple shampoo (1-2x weekly), and this product is one of my favorites to pick up! This purple shampoo does a great job of toning out the brassiness in my blonde without stripping the color and leaving my hair smelling fresh and clean!"
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have tried many purple shampoos, but this one is definitely the best one I’ve tried. It corrects any brassiness or yellowing of my light blonde hair. It also is moisturizing, gives my hair a shine, and does not dry my hair out."
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo! It has a great smell and texture in my hair, and prevents my blond color from going brassy. Bottle has lasted me months as well"
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,4 / 5,It smells great ! I also liked that this shampoo did not leave my hair dry compared to other purple shampoos. I feel like a little goes a long way so it has lasted me months. I believe that my hair is still a bit brassy hence 4 stars. If you plan on using this perhaps use it in conjunction with other purple shampoos to aid in reducing brassy hair color.
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,3 / 5,It’s okay. I feel it does more straining then actually lifting the yellow tones like other ones I have tried. Okay if I’m on a budget but not my preferred.
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,I have been embracing my silver sparkles for 16 months now and a purple shampoo is a must! I love how this one makes my hair feel after and how it tones the brassy COLOUR!

Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,Yellow and brassy tones are fixed when using this. You don't need alot of product to get the desired result. I think the smell is pretty decent too.
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,4 / 5,"It smells good and helps tone out brassy tones in your hair. For the price point there are other brands that do the same thing for less money but if you can afford it, go for it! It also smells great too!"
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"I have been using this product in conjunction with not toyrothers purple shampoo, the two together are the only mixture I've found that effectively dissipates the brassy and yellow tones in my hair keeping it looking freshly lightened"
Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,This is one of the very best purple shampoos out there. It gives great moisture with fabulous color. Truly one of the best out there for blonde!

Biolage ColorLast Purple Shampoo,5 / 5,"1st the purple color is just beautiful. Because I have mixuture of blonde, platinum and greyish tones I find this shampoo to help so much with brassiness. I only tend to wash my hair 2 times a week or so. 1st use is always put on semi damnp hair. I start at the root and allow the shampoo to sit there for the first few minutes before distributing to my ends. I always allowt purple shampoo to sit for about 5-7 minutes before I wash it out. If I wash a second time that week I will dilute the shampoo with a regular shampoo. Hope this helpa"

I was constantly in discomfort and I tried switching up my shampoo many times without success. Shampoo’s containing coal tar (the smell 💀) worked best, but the relief was short lived, and the irritation was always back the next day. My girlfriend convinced me to buy this shampoo as she’s very particular about what hair products she uses, and surprisingly this one has worked really well for my hair and scalp. It has a nice foamy lather, my hair feels clean and smooth after, and my scalp moisturized with no noticeable irritation. I’ll take that as a win. And to anyone in Canada, you can almost always find Joico at Winners for a discounted price. 😉"

Joico Moisture Recovery Shampoo 10.1 oz & Joico Moisture Recovery Conditioner 10.1 oz & Joico Moisture Recovery Treatment Balm 16.9 oz,2 / 5,NOT for everyday or every wash use. It is good for when you really need moisture but it does make your hair heavier and greasier over time! Not a fan
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"**Rogue Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse** I recently discovered the Rogue Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse, and I can't express how thrilled I am to have found it. As someone who washes their hair every other day, I've struggled with my hair and scalp becoming excessively dry due to frequent shampooing. Using this rinse just two days after my wash has transformed my hair; it feels incredibly soft and looks rejuvenated. Not only has it brought back a healthy shine, but I've also noticed a significant improvement in my scalp's texture—no more dryness or irritation from the harsh shampoos and conditioners I've relied on. One of the best parts is that after using the rinse, my hair doesn’t feel oily or greasy at all. Plus, the scent is surprisingly pleasant, adding to the overall delightful experience. This product has truly become an essential part of my hair care routine!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,2 / 5,"Honestly I feel like I wasted my money. My sister and I bought this product because it had good reviews and we both have very oily hair and we were hoping this would be an alternative to washing our hair but it just made our hair more greasy, you need to use such a small amount its hard to measure how much is too much and you end up having to wash your hair anyways. Perhaps its not meant for our hairtype but i will not be buying again ."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,I’m not sure how I feel about it but I love that the acv rinse lathers like a shampoo! Definitely not what I was expecting. I may purchase again in the future!
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I wanted to hate this product but it’s amazing! I don’t know how it does it but it washes my hair without washing it and leaves it super soft. I have very fine oily hair and don’t like to wash my hair every day, sometimes I’ll use this between shampoo days and it’s like completely freshened up. It is a little pricy but I really do love this product."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,3 / 5,"I’m not the biggest fan of the ACV scent— I noticed that the shampoo is a lot more subtle than the conditioner… the conditioner is unbearable— I feel like fruit flies are going to come looking for me when I have the conditioner in my hair(maybe a little exaggerated); it does give my hair/scalp a fresh, revitalizing feeling, but it doesn’t help me with reduced shedding, at least not as of yet, I’ve been using it for a week now… because of how strong the conditioner is, I won’t be buying it again."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,I tried this product and instantly fell in love . I hate the smell of vinegar but will put it aside just for this product . Made my hair instantly softer and shiny. My scalp has never felt cleaner . 10/10 recommend!!
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"This apple cider rinse rinses away impurities and replaces shampoo. It also has color locking technology. After your hair dries, it feels so healthy! I've never had a more healthier feeling head of hair!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,I love this product. This saves me from washing my hair consistently since I work out so much! It has definitely been a game changer and I also like all of the other products as well!
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I’m an everyday hair washer. I know, it’s not good for your hair. BUT, my roots get very greasy. So, I tried this ACV hair rinse in place of shampoo and I hooked! I use this at least 3 times a week in place of my shampoo to prevent from over washing my hair. It does smell like vinegar, but my hair doesn’t smell like vinegar once rinsed out. My hair feels clean once dried and styled, just like I shampooed! I would definitely recommend swapping this with your shampoo at least a couple times a week!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,2 / 5,I was really excited to try this even though my mom didn’t like it and gave it to me to try. I think with the nozzle it was able to apply very easily. It smells like apple cider vinegar but it also smells a bit herbal too and the vinegar smell dissipates. I felt like it cleaned well and gave my hair a nice shine. It only lasts a day though before my hair gets greasy and I have really dry hair that I wash every 3 days so getting greasy overnight is not normal for me. It might work better for someone else.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"i got one really love this product, prior to buying this i would do a diy ACV rinse but it does take prep so once i saw this in stores i had to try it. a great plus is that it doesn’t have the strong smell like regular ACV does so in case you’re sensitive to smell, but on top of that it does really good cleansing you’re scalp and hair and it also feels very moisturizing i feel it does add shine and it also helps prevent dandruff"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,"I used this for about two years in the past. Back then I was running daily so I would wash my hair daily (still do for the most part), and I loved this as a shampoo replacement. I used it on most days and it kept my scalp healthy without drying out my hair. Some people don’t like the smell but I didn’t mind it too much. I have thick dense hair so I like the original version. If your hair is on the thinner side, try the lite version (I used a bottle of this one more recently but it wasn’t a good match for me)."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"This ACV rinse/shampoo does a fabulous job clarifying hair and scalp without leaving her dry like most clarifyers do. It actually leaves hair quite soft and bouncy. My curly hair loves this shampoo, I just wish the price tag made more sense. $35 for such a small bottle is a big ouchie, especially to those of us with curly long hair."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,I love this rinse! I have dry hair but an oily scalp and I feel like this really helps. It does smell like ACV a little bit but it’s totally worth it.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"Let me just say, I have tried so many high end hair products and I currently had been using redken so soft and the redken acidic bonding, the soft one did make my hair soft. I do still have dandruff and some psoriasis so I thought I would give this a try and it blew me out of the water, better than any other hair shampoo substitutes I have ever tried. It's so easy to use, I just added to my roots and worked it in, let it sit and rinse and some conditioner on the end and rise my hair was the softest and shiny it had ever been."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,This brand ACV wash was not an option so I chose something similar. This stuff is fantastic. I purchased the mixer bottle with it so I could mix with water before applying. This smells good but like vinegar however the smell does dissipate. This makes my hair so soft and I use it after shampooing with a shampoo bar. It’s used like a clarifying agent to remove build up but softens like a conditioner. Easy to brush my almost waist length hair too!
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,3 / 5,"Awesome product, it's great for hair build up,however the price is a little steep, I like to made my own with apple cider vinegar and water."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,"I really enjoyed this product! It does have a strong smell, but you should expect that with Apply Cider Vinegar products. This kept my hair clean from build up and actually added a great amount of softness!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,So it def doesn’t smell great but apple cider smells horrid so they’ve definitely helped mute that by a lot ! Results are worth the slightly bleh scent this may have. The shine in my hair after using this product is incredible. Love it
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,This is great when you want to skip a wash. Doesn't have a strong acv smell and it lathers a little bit. I only rubbed it into my scalp to rinse the oil away. My hair was less frizzy but not as shiny though. It did wash away the oiliness and my hair was easy to manage. I would purchase this item as a part of my haircare.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,1 / 5,I have a very dry scalp living in NYC this winter and thought this product would help. Unfortunately it hasn’t made any different. Wouldn’t recommend to someone looking for help w dry scalp
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,2 / 5,"For fine hair that tends to get greasy at the roots this just doesn’t do the trick. The smell is unpleasant, the texture watery, and it is a very mild shampoo. Unless you’re doing co wash or no shampoo I would skip this product."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"Originally discovered this after looking for a shampoo that both my boyfriend and I could use - he has very fine, oily, thin hair while I have much thicker, dry, wavy hair. To my surprise this works well for the both of us even after working out in south Florida heat. I do follow up with a conditioner though the bottle suggests this can replace both shampoo and conditioner. Since I’ve been using this product I’ve found my hair to be shinier , softer and less brassy. I also did it soothing on my scalp. Also gives me an extra 2-3 days between shampoos."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I love using this rinse to reduce buildup or when my hair feels weighed down. I have gone through three bottles, so this is a staple for me. It makes my hair feel soft and look shiny. I used it every two weeks."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,Cleans the scalp really well ! Leaves my hair feeling shiny and soft ! Gets rid of the build up !! I just love it
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,Love love love!!! I fried my hair 2 years ago. It was soo dry and dead. I use this to shampoo only for an entire year and it kept my scalp sooo healthy and helped grow my long. ( by keeping my hair and scalp ph balanced and not being harsh) it also gets rid of any buildup on your scalp. So your hair follicles stay clean and clear so hair can grow nicely. It’s a staple for me. Nothing like it in the market. #applecidervinegar #blondehair #longhair
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I Love this Vinegar Hair rinse by ACV . I was a little skeptical on the how it was going to leave my hair smelling ,but it’s not to strong at ALL! I like to use this when my hair is feeling extra dry, frizzy and brittle. After I wash my hair I use a light application of this once a week on my hair and it makes it feel and look brand new again. This is a gods gift for woman who regularly use heat on their hair like myself. It doesn’t strip you of your natural oils from your scalp so it leaves it feeling soft and silky and the shine is outstanding. I would recommend this product."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,I use this apple cider vinegar hair rinse before shampoo and conditioner. I don’t really know the right way but I am sure it it’s good to put before shampoo because it helps to prepare my dirty hair for cleaning.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,Works well. Noticeable difference after only one use. You shampoo as normal then put this stuff in and let it sit (like conditioner) as time passes your hair will feel more silky.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,Makes my hair feeling refreshed after using this every week. It is so good on my scalp too! Makes it less dry and itchy.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,[product:dphue-apple-cider-vinegar-hair-rinse] my hair feels lighter after use. Also really like the fact it has natural ingredients.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I'm in awe with this hair rinse. Love the fact that the ingredients are pretty decent and natural. Also, it isn't loaded with fragrances, which is extremely important for me personally."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I have heard very mixed reviews about apple cider vinegar hair rinses so I was so excited to have the opportunity to try this. 🍏 After a few tries I think I’m starting to get the hang of it. After the first time of use I found my hair felt crunchy and like it still had product in it. I found I was using too much product and left it in too long. Fast forward a few more tries I’ve learnt you really do not need a lot, leave it in for a max of 5 mins and make sure you rinse it out really well. Here’s how I have found best results: - get my hair wet and then squeeze out all the extra water so it’s only damp - using the bottle squeeze a small amount down the middle of your scalp and then a small line on either side (just above your ears) - massage it into your head really well to work it all around - leave in for a MAX of 5 minutes - rinse out really well!! For those who don’t love the smell of apple cider you will still enjoy this as it doesn’t have an over powering smell and that goes away once it’s in your hair. I have noticed my hair has more volume and more shiny after using this weekly. If you have not tried this I strongly suggest giving it a go. I’ll be putting this into my weekly routine for now on!!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I’m shocked at how well this stuff actually works, especially after days of dry shampoo. My scalp feels so clean. Will def repurchase"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,3 / 5,"Wasn’t impressed. The first time I used it my hair felt oily and looked greasy. I gave it another shot and it looked and felt better, but not any better than my normal hair care."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,2 / 5,"I've never tried a rinse product on my hair before and to be honest was a little hesitant to do so , but I gave it a shot! I was hesitant with it being Vinegar, but surprisingly the scent was not too overbearing at all but wasn't a bundle of roses either. So if you can tolerate scented products you'll be fine. Thanks to Influenster I got to try something new for me to experience. After applying it to my hair , It felt like it had a really oily texture which took long to rinse off. I didnt really see or feel much of a difference to my hair using it the few times that I did. I personally did not see anything significant about it , but not everything is for everyone so hopefully it did wonders for someone else trying it !"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,3 / 5,-It takes a few applications to get used to. At first I was worried it made my hair look greasy but after a few uses it started to look more shiny than greasy. -Make sure you don’t have too many products already in your hair before using this. It seemed to itch one day I used it after I had done my hair and used product already. -I’m personally not a big Apple cider vinegar fan but this scent grew on me as it was very light- depending on how much you use. -While I think this product works I might explore other similar products first before going back to this one.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,Smells good makes my hair shine & not greasy keeps it feeling clean since I struggle with greasy hair not everything works on my hair and this makes my hair smooth also.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I received this product as a free sample. I was a little bit hesitant at first when I got it, didn’t quite believe it would work, and I’m pleased to say I was wrong! It took me 2-3 washes to figure out the right amount needed for my hair, but now it’s become part of my routine. And it does substitute the shampoo! I have color treated hair (used to have it bleached and now have it died medium brown), it made my hair very shiny and the color popped more! Also, even though it smells a bit like vinegar, it’s not a very strong scent. Super recommend!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I received this this product to try complementary from Influenster. I’ll admit, I was skeptical. I have trained my hair and only wash it once or twice a week. This product said it could be used instead of shampoo. So I tried it!! My hair felt great and did not get any greasier than normal (while continuing to use my maintenance products). It didn’t strip my hair and left it feeling hydrated. I plan to add it to my mid-week routine between washes! Also, for being an apple cider vinegar product, the scent was not overwhelming (like I expected)!! I am impressed. #haircare #hairrinse #applecidervinegar #omgacv #huecrew #complimentary @Influenster @dphue"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,"so I wasnt really sure what to make of this, i never used a product like it. So i read and made sure to follow the directions. And from just applying it I could tell this was different. Its isnt a shampoo yet it did a better job cleaning my hair. Wasnt sure if I should conditioner or not so my 1st use I just tried it by itself. While I was washing my hair it felt softer like if I had used conditioner. It wasnt as soft as if I used conditioner. But amazingly my hair was still manageable and I didnt have a bunch of breakage. I really like this ACV rinse. The smell isnt great but doesnt linger"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"Woah! Talk about squeaky clean! Never used a hair rinse before but I received this as a free sample! Absolutely love the ingredients of this one! Has almost no scent to it, which is surprising given it is ACV. definitely softens my hair well! Gives a nice shine."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,2 / 5,Sad to say this product was not for me. Supposed to clean and protect your hair but it made my long hair greasy and was not able to go a few days without washing. Mimicked my hair at day 7 of not washing. Gave to my mom with short hair and she didn’t notice a difference. The one good thing is that the smell is not overpowering and the bottle is nice for applying.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,3 / 5,"I used it on my roots as was suggested. It did seem to remove the oils from my hair, but my hair just didn't feel clean enough for me. It left my scalp feeling dry and the smell was a bit overpowering, which lingered even after I rinsed. It would be good to use for once a week to try to limit harsh chemicals and build up but not a good choice for a shampoo replacement. I would recommend to others as it may do good on their hair type."
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,3 / 5,This shampoo is very light. It lathers a little. I need to use a lot of product to satisfy my hair cleansing routine. My hair feels soft and at the same time it’s oily afterwards. It smells like apple cider vinegar as expected. I think it will be great for those who have dry scalps.
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,"This product did work to cleanse my scalp compared to my usual shampoo. I didn’t have any left over buildup from dry shampoo like I usually do. Unfortunately it made my hair really oily even after rinsing very well. I think this product would be good to use occasionally to cleanse the scalp. It does smell of apple cider vinegar during use, but it didn’t smell strong after rinsing it out. I received this product from Influenster as part of a VoxBox campaign. [product:dphue-apple-cider-vinegar-hair-rinse]"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,"I am very surprised at how good this made my hair feel. I have curly and dry hair so it always needs some sort of conditioner but I wanted to try this without using conditioner and my hair was so soft and it wasn’t frizzy and also had a lot of volume. It made my hair feel clean and it didn’t have that horrible apple cider vinegar smell that I was expecting, it didn’t smell great but the smell does not linger in your hair at all. I also think the bottle will go fast because I have thick long hair and it is pricy for the size of the bottle. Overall I think it is worth it if you want your hair to feel clean and don’t want to kver shampoo it!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I got it from Influester as a voxbox two years ago and it is pretty good product . It smells not reaally good but effect on my hair was really amazing , after it my hair was shining and looked more healthy . #influenster #hair #shampoo #voxbox #loveit"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,4 / 5,"dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar hair rinse is a great addition to my weekly hair care maintenance. It’s a gentle co-wash that I use once a week in between shampooing that treats my scalp, protects the color of my roots and gently cleanses my hair without stripping it if it’s natural oils. The only downside is that the bottle is quite small for the price and I have a lot of hair so I go through it rather quickly. . This hair rinse is made with artisanal crafted Apple Cider Vinegar from George Paul Vinegary and infused with Argan oil, aloe Vera and lavender extract to help seal the cuticle and add softness and shine. Does not leave a harsh scent!"
dpHUE Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse,5 / 5,"I have thicker, fine, color treated hair. I live a pretty active lifestyle and unfortunately am someone who sweats SO MUCH. like there is no way I can workout and not wash my hair afterwards. I know shampooing your hair everyday is not healthy, so this product is a miracle product for me. It’s easy to apply by turning your head upside down and squirting it from the bottle onto your scalp. Using this product allows me to go a day or two between shampoos. It smells only slightly of apple cider vinegar. You do have to use a good amount to get a clean feeling scalp and given that it’s a little pricey that is the one downside. I don’t think I will totally replace shampooing my hair with using this rinse, but it’s a great alternative for going between washes. I will absolutely be repurchasing after I finish the bottle I have."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,4 / 5,"Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo is a lifesaver for oily hair. I rely on it to purify my hair and reset it back to normal after using other shampoos that contain silicone or heavy residues. It effectively removes buildup without stripping my hair of essential oils, leaving it feeling clean and refreshed. It's a must-have in my hair care routine, especially for maintaining volume and preventing that weighed-down feeling. The only downside is the scent is a bit perfumey for me."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,1 / 5,"This shampoo absolutely ruined my hair. I was having issues with buildup after washing so I wanted a good clarifying shampoo to help get some of the buildup out of my hair. It does it’s job, it certainly got all of the buildup out, but at a cost. After a few weeks of using this shampoo I noticed my ends were becoming increasingly dryer and frizzy and after washing my hair would start to break when brushing, almost to the point similar to if it was over processed at a salon. My hair went from shiny and healthy to frizzy and dry with signs of breakage all over. I have not used the shampoo in a few weeks and have done multiple overnight conditioning treatments with no luck. This has not happened to my hair with ANY other shampoo. I am devastated and I wish I never purchased it. Do your hair a favor and buy a salon quality clarifying treatment."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,Perfect to strip silicone based hair gloss product buildup a few days before coloring. Hair feels a bit crunchy after use but it's worth it. Light pleasant scent. Very affordable and a little goes a long way.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"Love that this shampoo removes all the buildup from the daily hair products I use. It can be a bit too strong for my liking and I found using it once a week made my hair feel really dry so now I use this once every two weeks and no more dryness. Affordable price and good size bottle that lasts me over 6 months, as you don’t need a lot of this."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I love this shampoo so so much!!!! First of all, it has pleasant smell and so much lather. It completely removes residue, refreshes my scalp once a week. Sadly, I have no idea why it is not easy to find the shampoo on the shelves or it sometimes is overpriced."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,4 / 5,"I REALLY enjoyed using this shampoo. It isn't something that I used daily, more so a weekly shampoo. It isn't strongly scented and made my hair feel extra clean and soft."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"This is a great Clarifying shampoo. I stopped using it when I started to color my hair, that's how well it works!! It's not drying but you do get rid of a lot of impurities!!!!!! I used it every other wash. Great price and really works. If I decide to go natural again, this will be first on my list!!!!"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I got this as a cheaper alternative to my other clarifying shampoo, and while it’s certainly not luxury, it got the job done and didn’t kill my hair. I find use of a clarifying shampoo every week or two to keep my hair soft. I’m also a swimmer. Ultimately, it’s not my first choice but it’s a great option for something more affordable."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,3 / 5,"My hair is fine and builds up easily, becomes vwry frizzy, so I need clarifying shampoos. This is a classic that I tried first, because the pricepoint and the packaging make sense. It does a good job deep cleaning my hair. The downsize is it leaves it too dry and a little brittle, so i use it now and then for a good deep clean."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,2 / 5,"This was way too strong on my hair. I know it is supposed to strip away residue, but it felt like it stripped away all of my hair’s natural moisture too"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,3 / 5,"This was one of the first clarifying shampoos I tried. I will say it does get the job done, but I don’t think I will use this product again since trying other options that work better."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,4 / 5,"This shampoo is great for removing residue, but extremely drying to the hair so it should really be reserved for heavy duty clarification. Also be gentle with your hair after use since the hair is so dry and doesn’t have a lot of slip to it."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I like it a lot. It’s one of the best drug store brands shampoos. I have thick hairs and normally it’s so hard to wash all the way through. This cleans my hair very well and I do not need to put too much effort in to wash hair all the way through.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This is my go to drug store clarifying shampoo! I fully believe this is the best bang for your buck. I spent several minutes looking for in the grocery store aisle only to realize it wasn’t in stock.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I have oily hair. I use this shampoo once a month to clean all the gunk built up out of my hair from styling and daily products.. love the feeling of CLEAN hair!
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,4 / 5,"I bought this shampoo after looking for a drugstore version of a clarifying shampoo. I use dry shampoo a lot and normal shampoo just didn’t do the trick to get it all out of my hair. Needless to say, it works pretty well!"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,2 / 5,"So this does what it says, it removes residue/build-up, but it is so incredibly drying. My hair felt like it was stripped of an entire layer, and was very tangled and unmanageable after. Only giving two stars because it actually removes residue, but there are better options out there"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This shampoo is the holy grail of clarifying products! If your hair is full of product build up use this shampoo to reset your strands. Great for cleansing hair brushes too!
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"Il enlève tellement bien les résidus de la vie de tout les jours, poussière, pollution, shampooing sec. Mes cheveux sont tellement léger après l'avoir utilisé! Je l'adore"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I love this clarifying shampoo! I use it once every week and it has helped remove build up from my hair from the over use of products and general sweat/grime. It has been difficult for me to find this lately which is a complete bummer I hope they restock soon!
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I absolutely love this shampoo and use it maybe once a week instead of my regular shampoo and get rid of any residue built up from other products. My hair always feel so clean after using this. Unfortunately it seems as though its difficult to get hold of in the UK otherwise I would be using it all the time!
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I loved using this every 1-2 weeks to give my hair a nice reset and to remove any product build up or oils. My hair always would come out so clean afterwards !
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This shampoo is my first pick for really clarifying the hair and scalp and removing product buildup. I do find that I have to use a lot of shampoo because it doesn’t lather. But I only use this around once a month and the price point is really great. Everyone who uses leave in hair products needs to try this!
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"My hair has never felt cleaner. Most hair products contain wax that will leave a residue but this completely strips those out first use. My hair was oil free, light, and I only use every few weeks."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I’ve been using Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo forever, once a week or once every two weeks depending on how often I wash my hair. For reference, I have low porosity, coarse, medium density hair. I have tried other clarifying shampoos but this one is the best out there. And it works for both my sister’s hair types too, one has very thick hair and one has very fine hair. I think this shampoo works well for all hair types as a great charging shampoo to get rid of excess product build up, as well as dirt and oils. My scalp feels clean afterwards but not completely dried out like some clarifying shampoos. It’s the perfect balance"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,Great shampoo to use every week or so. It really gets rid of build up from other hair products and even conditioners. It gives my hair that extra lightness and oomph it needs.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I've purchased this as a clarifying shampoo for years. It's simple and effective. My hair always feels great after and is easier to style. Does the job for a fraction of the cost. Would purchase over expensive products!
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I really like Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo, and I purchase it frequently. It works great to get rid of build up and residue on my hair. It is perfect to use once a week and my hair always looks great afterwards."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I bought this to deep clean my hair which felt heavy and limp with various products and oils etc. This did a great job and left my hair feeling light & healthy.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"When you need a terrific clarifying shampoo, this classic from Neutragena works great! I recommend using it once a week with the lather, rinse, repeat method."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"If you really want to clean your scalp & hair, this product is it! This is great at removing all the hairspray, etc after a night out or attending an event."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,Really great clarifying shampoo for greasy hair. Cleans deep while leaving your hair shinny. Its the best deep cleaning shampoo that I tried.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I have great results with this shampoo anytime I need to remove build up from my hair, hair styling products, oil, dirt, etc. I also use it a couple days before coloring my hair, great reset product! Always have on hand."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I don't care for the smell of this shampoo but considering it's purpose isn't to be pleasant smelling, it's fine. The soap makes my hair feel so stripped of all the funky mess of day to day hair fixing. I only use it about once or twice a month at best, but it certainly helps."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"This product stands the test of time. Hair feels clean after using. Don’t use it everyday, but part of my bimonthly routine. No plans to change something that works so well."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This is the best cleansing shampoo for the best price! I use it once a week and it makes my hair and scalp soooo soft and refreshed! definitely gets rid of any buildup.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I like using this shampoo at least once a week to stop it looking like Darth Vadars helmet, i curl my hair most days and it started to get difficult to get the curl to stay longer than a couple of hours which was frustrating as i have straight hair naturally after trying different things to keep the curl in i kinda realised my hair was congested so i found this and began using it in between my other shampoo, i have noticed a better bounce, more shine even tho my hair is bleached it just looks and feels nicer. Another thing i have found also is in warm weather and you get all sweaty my head doesn't itch, i love the shampoo its great value and once i revert back to dark hair will more than likely use as sole shampoo"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"THIS STUFF WAS THE BOMB. It would get the grime your ancestors had from 10 generations back out of your hair. Do you do something you think is going to show up in a hair analysis? That’s gone, too. This will strip EVERYTHING. I mean, do a deep condition after because it’ll also strip the soul and life giving water from your hair. This is also anecdotal and it’s just a brilliant clarifying shampoo."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"This shampoo is amazing at getting rid of yucky build up. I use it once a week-on Sunday’s before the beginning I n the week and it leaves my hair super squeaky clean. It feels soft abs again, scalp feels very clean ;) l really love this one and have been using it for years."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"Have purchased this shampoo multiple times over the years. It is lightweight, does not smell, and does a great job removing product buildup from hair without drying it out. Your hair feels nice and clean after use."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This was the absolute best clarifying affordable shampoo please bring it back!!! My hair always felt great and refreshed after
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This is a staple in our home. My husband has oily hair and after a long work day this get his hair very clean. It gets out all the buildup but doesn’t damage his hair. I have used it to clarify my hair before a treatment.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I use this shampoo to reset my hair so to speak. It takes the build up off of my hair. My hair just feels so much more lighter after using this.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I was recommended this product on a forum specialized for curly hairs. It did its job as advertized and clarified my scalp, removed the buildups. Despite the small bottle, a little goes a long way, in my experience. A bottle lasts for a while."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. And I haven’t been able to find it anywhere. If you want to get all the built up residue out of your hair, this is it!!!"
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"This is the best shampoo. It's gets your hair so clean, but be sure to use a deep conditioner after. I don't know if it has been discontinued because I can't find it anywhere, but I hope they bring it back."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,I love that I can feel it working to remove all the gunk left by Moroccan Oil. This is a staple product in my bath. I love that I can feel it working to remove all the gunk left by Moroccan Oil. This is a staple product in my bath
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"Love this shampoo, works really well to clarify product buildup. Slightly medicinal smell that doesn’t linger. Good for using once a week."
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,This shampoo is always on rotation every week. It leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean without the build up. I love that it has a mild scent too.
Neutrogena The Anti-Residue Shampoo®,5 / 5,"Not only does this deeply deeply cleanse your hair from all build-up and residue, leaving it feeling super soft, light, and clean! but if you accidentally over-tone your bleached hair, or use temporary colours that stain - it’ll seriously help remove the extra colour buildup without having to resort to harsh chemicals like colorB4. For that reason, this should live in every bathroom for emergencies at the very least, let alone how awesome it is for a weekly deep clean in between regular shampoos."
L'Oreal Paris Frizz Defy Sulfate Free Shampoo With Marula Oil,5 / 5,Love this shampoo. It leaves my hair soft and sleek. Helps with frizz. You don’t need a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean. It is not a big bottle but a little goes a long way.
L'Oreal Paris Frizz Defy Sulfate Free Shampoo With Marula Oil,5 / 5,I got this product a few years back from influenster and I have not stopped using it. I usually get a couple extra when my store restocks. Very affordable in price. And its the onlu product that works for frizzy hair. Its sulfate free which is good. And leaves your hair soft and smelling wonderful.
L'Oreal Paris Frizz Defy Sulfate Free Shampoo With Marula Oil,4 / 5,"I have very thick, very long, curly hair and frizz is a top issue for me, so of course, I try to find products that help keep the frizz at bay. Because I also color my hair, I try to find products that are protect my color as well and the sulfate free L’Oréal products are perfect. If you’re looking for a nice drugstore shampoo to combat that frizz and give your hair a bit of shine, this is a great choice. I love that is is sulfate and paraben free. It’s got a beautiful floral scent that isn’t super overpowering but gives you that natural clean scent after a shower. The packaging is definitely eye-catching but I do wish there were more in it. Because my hair is so long and thick, I go through hair products like crazy but if you’re just a normal person that can make a regular bottle of shampoo last that’s don’t really affect you like it does me."
L'Oreal Paris Frizz Defy Sulfate Free Shampoo With Marula Oil,4 / 5,"The L’Oreal Paris Frizz Defy Sulfate Free Shampoo wWith Maryland Oil is great!
